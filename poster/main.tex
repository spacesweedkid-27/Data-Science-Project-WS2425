    \begin{block}{Motivation} 
        Not only is it interesting to look at popular music from the point of view of musicians aspiring to create the next hit single. Indeed, it is also interesting to analyse recent music since music is an essential part of any culture.
        By analysing popular music one can learn about what the current culture is, how it changed and how it varied.
        In the following, we'll look at the most popular music of the last two decades to answer which musical and lyrical elements we can identify and analyse the change of them.

    \begin{block}{Chord Progressions}
    What chord progression should you use to write the perfect song? By scraping chords, identifying their key signature and looking for repeated patters, we found the most frequently used harmonic and interval progressions of the last 20 years, see figure \ref{fig:harmony}.
