создании песни они делятся на следующие категории primary artist исполнитель от имени которого вышла песня кредитсы genius должны строго соответствовать данным со стриминговых сервисов прежде всего apple music если там главный исполнитель представлен списком из нескольких артистов то и вам в поле « primary artist » нужно сгруппировать имена всех исполнителей в одну запись затем через функцию « add additional credit » создать поле « primary artist » и уже там указать имя каждого из исполнителей по отдельности исключением являются « супергруппы » — музыкальные коллективы собранные из уже состоявшихся артистов на стриминговых сервисах их названия часто дополняют именами участников для упрощения оставьте только название группы writer в поле авторов указывают людей которые участвовали в создании песни причём к ним относятся как авторы музыки так и авторы слов featured artist приглашённые исполнители — это артисты которые сделали значительный вклад в создание песни как правило своим вокалом или соавторством producer тут имеются в виду продюсеры музыки в хип-хопе чаще всего это человек написавший бит additional credit этот раздел охватывает всех остальных профессионалов сделавших вклад в создание песни сюда входят музыканты игравшие на определенных инструментах звукорежиссёры и т.д когда нужно/нельзя добавлять кредитсы добавлять данные на genius можно только если они были предоставлены официально это значит что заполнять кредитсы на основе собственных домыслов строго запрещено будьте готовы в любой момент предъявить авторитетный источник подтверждающий ваши кредитсы

иногда прилагаются в электронном виде общества по защите авторских прав это организации помогающие исполнителям получать отчисления за их музыкальные произведения чтобы авторское общество знало кому выплачивать деньги авторы регистрируют свои песни в реестре этого общества — как искать кредитсы на сайтах авторских обществ стриминговые сервисы такие стриминги как spotify apple music tidal хранят кредитсы у себя в метаданных — как искать кредитсы на стриминговых сервисах социальные медиа информацию об авторах песен нередко предоставляют авторитетные сми и даже сами исполнители у себя в соцсетях её можно использовать в качестве кредитсов если источник заслуживает доверия прочие сайты профессиональные сайты по сбору музыкальных метаданных вроде allmusic или discogs вполне подходят в качестве источников краудсорсинговые сайты вроде википедии можно использовать в качестве справочных материалов но информация оттуда требует подкрепления дополнительными ресурсами перечень музыкальных профессий и их принятое написание одна и та же музыкальная профессия в разных источниках может именоваться немного по-разному поэтому мы разработали собственный перечень с названиями музыкантов при заполнении кредистов обращайтесь к нему чтобы выбрать форму написания принятую у нас на сайте обратите внимание что в списке перечислены только часто используемые кредитсы если кредитс который вы хотите указать не добавляется обратитесь к редакторам или модераторам за помощью при заполнении кредитсов помните что у каждой роли должно быть отдельное поле для каждой из музыкальных профессий в
