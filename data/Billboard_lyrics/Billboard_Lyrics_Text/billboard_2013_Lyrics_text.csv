1,"""Thrift Shop""",Macklemore & Ryan Lewis featuring Wanz,https://genius.com/Billboard-hot-rap-songs-chart-25th-anniversary-top-100-songs-lyrics,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation

To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history.

If you can't hear what I'm tryna say (
Hey, girl, come here

If you can't read from the same page 
Maybe I'm goin' deaf 
Maybe I'm goin' blind 
Maybe I'm out of my mind

Tried to domesticate you
But you're an animal

Just let me liberate you 
You don't need no takers 
That man is not your maker 
And that's why I'm gon' take a 
Good girl
I know you want it 
I know you want it

You're a good girl
Can't let it get past me
You're far from plastic 
Talkin' 'bout gettin' blasted
I hate these blurred lines
I know you want it 
I know you want it 
I know you want it
But you're a good girl
The way you grab me
Must wanna get nasty
Go ahead, get at me
Everybody, get up 
What do they make dreams for 
When you got them jeans on? 
What do we need steam for?
You the hottest bitch in this place
I feel so lucky 
You wanna hug me 
What rhymes with hug me?

Ay, say Rob, let me holla at 'em real quick
One thing I ask of you
Let me be the one you back that ass up to 
Go from Malibu to Paris, boo 
Had a bitch, but she ain't bad as you
So, hit me up when you pass through
I'll give you somethin' big enough to tear your ass in two
Swag on 'em even when you dress casual
I mean, it's almost unbearable 
In a hundred years not dare would I
Pull a Pharcyde, let you pass me by
Nothin' like your last guy, he too square for you
He don't smack that ass and pull your hair like that
So I'm just watchin' and waitin'
For you to salute the true big pimpin' 
Not many women can refuse this pimpin'
I'm a nice guy, but don't get it confused, get pimpin' 
Shake your rump
Get down, get up-a
Do it like it hurt, like it hurt
What, you don't like work?
Hey 
Baby, can you breathe?
I got this from Jamaica
It always works for me
Dakota to Decatur 
No more pretendin'  
'Cause now you're winnin'  
Here's our beginnin'  
I always wanted a

'Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror

Parallel on the other side

Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror

That we're making

And with every touch, you fixed them
Now you've been talkin' in your sleep, oh, oh
Things you never say to me, oh, oh
Tell me that you've had enough of our love, our love
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

You're not broken, just bent

Oh, tears ducts and rust
I'll fix it for us
We're collectin' dust
But our love's enough
You're holdin' it in
You're pourin' a drink
No, nothin' is as bad as it seems
We'll come clean
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's still written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
Oh, we can learn to love again
Oh, can learn to love again
Oh, that we're not broken, just bent

8,"""When I Was Your Man""",Bruno Mars,https://genius.com/Bruno-mars-when-i-was-your-man-lyrics,"Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
It all just sounds like 
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancin'
But she's dancin' with another man
Uh, my pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like 
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancin'
But she's dancin' with another man
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that
I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you love to dance
Do all the things I should've done
When I was your man
Do all the things I should've done
When I was your man"

You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Ayy, baby
Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She’s poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, ""Oh, good lord,"" she had them long tanned legs
Couldn't help myself, so I walked up and said
Well, baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road, blowin' stop signs through the middle every little farm town with you
And this brand new Chevy with a lift kit would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it, heh
So, baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Well, she was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker
We were fallin' in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
""Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck""
Baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road, blowin' stop signs through the middle every little farm town with you
And this brand new Chevy with a lift kit would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it, heh
So, baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
When that summer sun fell to his knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
Because it felt so right, her and I, man, we felt so right
I put it in park and grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl, you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin'
Hell, I can't get you out of my head
Baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise 
Down a back road, blowin' stop signs through the middle every little farm town with you
Well, baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road, blowin' stop signs through the middle every little farm town with you
And this brand new Chevy with a lift kit would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it, come on
Baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Come on, girl
Get those windows down and cruise

I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything

You held me down, but I got up 
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

Somebody slow it down

43,"""Same Love""",Macklemore & Ryan Lewis featuring Mary Lambert,https://genius.com/Velyn-analyzing-same-love-persuasive-techniques-lyrics,"As it nears the end of 2015’s LGBT Pride Month, it felt most appropriate to analyze 
“Same Love”
 Macklemore, Ryan Lewis, and Mary Lambert’s Pro-LGBT anthem. This song was written as an advocacy piece for Washington Referendum 74  but ended up reverberating across the world
Although there are a variety of factors which optimized this trio's ability to influence political and social discourse to such an extent, rhetoric was by far the most pervasive. These techniques created a persuasive case for its listeners. Central to understanding its appeal is noting that this song does not function as a formal argument, rather it is best explained in a 
sermonic form
, which is established by the lyrics first six words
“When I was in the 3rd grade""
 sets the tone of the song by creating a testimony of experience. This helps ease the listener insofar as Macklemore is merely recounting an anecdote at this point, rather than offering an opinion on such a contentious issue. As such, this testimony derives from the use of a witness 
This use of testimony from witness derives from Aristotle who identified two types of witnesses: Ancient  and Immediate
These forms of witnesses can be found in Aristotle’s “Rhetoric” Book 1, Chapter 15. Ancient witnesses are defined as those “whose judgement is known to all”; such as poets and philosophers. Ancient witnesses derive from literature that has long held regard. They are the most authoritative witnesses and may only be taken as evidence for broad generalizations as they do not have context for present situations
Immediate witnesses are contemporary peers who “are well-known people who have expressed their opinions about some disputed matter.” They may be broken down into personal  or those who are merely well regarded. Personal witnesses may offer direct testimony to specific incidents but are easily suspected of prejudice. Well-regarded persons carry the authority of that regard, but may not testify regarding specific tasks
“Same Love” blends 
personal witness 
,  
well-regarded witness
 and 
ancient witness 
. The use of historic references here creates a sense of martyrdom, by intrinsically connecting successful social movements   with gay rights, a sense of justice is instilled and moral grounds for an argument are established. This creates a ""Christ-like"" figure in the victims of LGBT discrimination, as these individuals are being scapegoated for the ills of society and victimized; much in the manner that Christ was sacrificed for humanity's sins, while He himself being infallible
This blend diminishes the perceived weaknesses of specific witnesses. The power of testimony is that it serves as enthymematic evidence. In an enthymeme, we assume that the audience will supply presumptions, values, and perceptions. In testimony, the audience supplements the assertion by supplying rationale from their own experience; that is, their personal narratives only strengthen Macklemore’s story
This is why the continued references to technology are so effective. 
“Youtube comments”
, and 
“message boards”
 equalize our experiences. It is a safe assumption that the audience hearing this song have at some point used derogatory language, or seen it used by others, on the internet. While we may not discuss this issue in public, its mention will elicit a 
hesitant nod from its listeners
The dichotomies formed in these lyrics create a powerful influence, drawing purposeful contradictions between those who are 
“playing God”
 and the capacity to which 
“God loves”.
 To further scathingly taunt those who hide behind the pretense of following God’s word, the writers assert that this interpretation is false doctrine stating that 
“When I was in church they taught me something else, if you preach hate at the service, those words aren’t anointed.”
The power of this song resides in the force of its testimony. As audience members find similar experience in their own stories, they can feel the force of the testimony narratives given by the authors. The form, from testimony to moral demand to biblical proof-text, carries the rhetorical resonance of sermon. Sermons typically build on text  and testimony  to create rhetorically powerful visions and effective moral demands for their audience
“Same Love” works effectively as a message to those who can identity with the narratives that ground it; giving a mighty voice, while others are 
“comfortable in remaining voiceless”.
 More broadly, “Same Love” creates a forceful message in a culture that has historically placed value in sermonic form. Hence, controversy, rather than distracting from the popular form of the song, actually enhances the songs cultural force as an anthem, persuading us to see all love, as the same love"

And with a word, all my love came rushin' out
And every whisper, it's the worst
Emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now
So I'll put my faith in somethin' unknown
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
But I'm tired of hope with nothin' to hold
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're givin' me such sweet nothin'
Sweet nothin', sweet nothin'
You're givin' me such sweet nothin'
It isn't easy for me to let it go
'Cause I've swallowed every single word
And every whisper, every sigh
Eats away at this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now
So I'll put my faith in somethin' unknown
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
But I'm tired of hope with nothin' to hold
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're givin' me such sweet nothin'
Sweet nothin', sweet nothin'
You're givin' me such sweet nothin'
And it's not enough to tell me that you care
When we both know the words are empty air
You give me nothing 
Nothing
Woah, woah, woah, sweet nothin' 
Woah, woah, woah, sweet nothin' "

When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand?
That I'm never changing who I am
So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand?
That I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand?
That I'm never changing who I am
This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes, to ashes
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand?
That I'm never changing who I am

No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?

‘Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home, I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now, huh
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd: totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out

Fuck it, I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, ""Give me twenty dollars, dollars!""
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college?
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, cliché
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now, typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: ""Please play!""
For Pete's sake, homie, pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through with forever, but—

I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight
So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel
Rock me, mama, any way you feel
Hey, mama, rock me
Rock me, mama, like the wind and the rain
Rock me, mama, like a southbound train
Hey, mama, rock me
Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays the guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more
So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel
Rock me, mama, any way you feel
Hey, mama, rock me
Yeah, rock me, mama, like the wind and the rain
Rock me, mama, like a southbound train
Hey, mama, rock me
Walking to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a headed west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I got to get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free
So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel
Rock me, mama, any way you feel
Hey, mama, rock me
Oh, rock me, mama, like the wind and the rain
Rock me, mama, like a southbound train
Hey, hey, mama, rock me

I know you're there, but I can't see you anymore

Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love

Now I'm dreaming, will I ever find you now?
I walk in circles, but I'll never figure out
What I mean to you, do I belong?
I try to fight this, but I know I'm not that strong
And I feel so helpless here
Watch, my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

This is it, boys, this is war
What are we waiting for?
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype
Save that for the black and white
Try twice as hard, and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style
And that's all right 
I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering
Just who I, who I, who I am
Oh, who am I? Mm-mm, mm-mm

Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks at home
Sorry to leave, Mom, I had to go
Who the fuck wants to die alone
All dried up in the desert sun?
My heart is breaking for my sister
And the con that she called ""love""
And then I look into my nephew's eyes
Man, you wouldn't believe
The most amazing things
That can come from
Some terrible nights
Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh
Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh

The other night, you wouldn't believe

I'd called you up, but we both agreed

And the hood girls want a smart nigga
College girls all want a thug

Rough sex, sayin' I love ya, but to kiss them is sayin' you mean that (
Bad, no

Oh the irony, got the bomb indeed, but the problem is probably a deep past
Still I'm feelin' of somethin' I need bad
Thinkin' if I get her, I get her to need this
I don't need emotions to open your deep sea
I conceive an ocean by goin' between legs
Beg? Nope—bed, floor, dope; go for it, couch now
Slow motion around, put it down
Lord knows she was gone 'fore the morn', hold up

She take pride in goin' out
And gettin' hollered at and sayin' nah

She don't wear make-up by the boatload
Ridin' through lake shore with the nose up
She don't really date much, but it slows her up
She got haters, but we all do

Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry

When I think of letting go
I know you wanna get behind the wheel, but only one Rida
Eyes shut, still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go, I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan, quake losers and survivors
Norway, no, you didn't get my flowers
No way to say it better, but the killer was a coward
Face just showered, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news, whole day went sour
Bitter moments got me feeling like a Lemonhead
Put you in the box just as poisonous as cigarettes
There go my regards, but regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless
Getting mad 'cause there's a quarter million on my necklace
DUI never said I was driving reckless
You and I know that jealously is not impressive
Oh no, I can't stop, I was destined

Buy my momma chandeliers, I'm in tears, dammit
Thirty years you'd have thought these emotions vanish
Tryna live, tryna figure how your sister vanished
No cheers, I know you woulda panicked

Caught up in the middle

I don't like walking around this old and empty house
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you, my dear
The stairs creak as you sleep, it's keeping me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
And some days, I can't even dress myself
It's killing me to see you this way
'Cause though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore
[Verse 2: Nanna, 
Ragnar
 & 
Both
]
There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
Well, tell her that I miss our little talks
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young
And full of life and full of love
Some days, I don't know if I am wrong or right
Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear
'Cause though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore
 Don't listen to a word I say
 The screams all sound the same
 Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore
You're gone, gone, gone away, I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothing we can do
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon
Now wait, wait, wait for me, please hang around
I'll see you when I fall asleep
 Don't listen to a word I say
 The screams all sound the same
 Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore
Don't listen to a word I say
 The screams all sound the same
 Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore
Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

Smilin' in the photobooth

You're comin' over
And we would talk all afternoon
Tonight we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace
Find your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip, whisper and say
""We're goin' all the way""
Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road, we'll be lovers for sho'
So tonight, kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side
Ayy, this could be perfect 
But we won't know unless we try 
I know you're nervous
So just sit back and let me drive
Tonight we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace
Find your hands all over me

Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, ""Stick it!""
So sick, I'm looking pale—wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick

The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren

Ain't slowin' it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel-towel

Far as hard drugs are, though, that's the past

Catching breath in a web of lies

Riding waves, playing acrobat
Shadowboxing the other half
Learning how to react
I've spent most of my time
Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right
Catch my breath
No one can hold me back, I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath
Won't let 'em get me down, it's all so simple now
Addicted to the love I found
Heavy heart, now a weightless cloud
Making time for the ones that count
I'll spend the rest of my time
Laughing hard with the windows down
Leaving footprints all over town
Keeping faith, karma comes around
I will spend the rest of my life
Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show

but lately
Her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
""The worst things in life come free to us""
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, banknotes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
, 
but lately
Her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
""The worst things in life come free to us""
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
But she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
An angel will die, covered in white
Closed eye and hopin' for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
, 
but lately
Her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
""The worst things in life come free to us""
And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And we don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe, we fly to the Motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
Angels to die"
76,"""Carry On""",Fun,https://genius.com/Fun-carry-on-lyrics,"Well, I woke up to the sound of silence
The cars were cutting like knives in a fist fight
And I found you with a bottle of wine
Your head in the curtains
And heart like the fourth of July
You swore and said
We are not
We are not shining stars
This I know
I never said we are
Though I've never been through hell like that
I've closed enough windows
To know you can never look back
If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on
Carry on, carry on
So I met up with some friends
At the edge of the night
At a bar off 75
And we talked and talked
About how our parents will die
All our neighbors and wives
But I'd like to think
I can cheat it all
To make up for the times I've been cheated on
And it's nice to know
When I was left for dead
I was found and now I don't roam these streets
I am not the ghost you are to me
If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
 and
Carry on
Woah
My head is on fire
But my legs are fine
After all they are mine
Lay your clothes down on the floor
Close the door
Hold the phone
Show me how
No one's ever gonna stop us now
'Cause we are
We are shining stars
We are invincible
We are who we are
On our darkest day
When we're miles away
So we'll come
We will find our way home
If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
 and
Carry on
No one's ever gonna stop us now"

Yeah, I bet you're bending God's ear talking 'bout me

You're trying not to think about turning around
You're trying not to get lost in the sound but that song is always on
So you sing along

You got that sun tan skirt and boots
Waiting on you to look my way and scoot
Your little hot self over here
Girl hand me another beer, yeah!
All them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin' down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Going to sound like a winner, winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that's my kind of night!
Might sit down on my diamond plate tailgate
Put in my country-rock, hip-hop mixtape
Little Conway, a little T-Pain, might just make it rain
You can hang your t-shirt on a limb
Hit that bank and we can ease on in
Soak us up a little moonlight
You know I know what you like, yeah!

You don’t have to throw back your 
pretty pink lemonade shooter
 and lean a little closer
You don’t have to keep on smiling that smile that’s driving me wild and when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
 and do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don’t have to keep me fallin’ like this
But it’d sure be cool if you did
You can’t shoot me down cause you already knocked me dead
Got me falling apart with my heart talking out of my head
Let your mind take a little back road
Just as far as you wanna go
Baby I’ll do whatever you wanna do
You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild

I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver
Don't know what I did next, all I know I couldn't stop
Word got around to the barflies and the baptists
My mama's phone started ringin' off the hook
I can hear her now, sayin' she ain't gonna have it
Don't matter how you feel, it only matters how you look
Go and fix your make up, girl, it's just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain't my mama's broken heart
I wish I could be just a little less dramatic
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holding the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there's nobody else to blame
Can't get revenge and keep a spotless reputation (
Ah
)
Sometimes revenge's just a choice you gotta make (
Ah
)
My mama came from a softer generation
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face
Go and fix your make up, girl, it's just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain't my mama's broken heart
Powder your nose, paint your toes
Line your lips and keep 'em closed
Cross your legs, dot your eyes
And never let 'em see you cry
Go and fix your make up, well, it's just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain't my mama's broken heart"

When I should be counting on you at my door
Did you forget about how we went around?
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore
Oh, anymore

They wanna stroll on a city sidewalk
I got a dress that'll show a little uh-uh

Come on, come on, come on, we're runnin' outta moonlight
Woah
Yeah, we're runnin' outta moonlight
Woah"
99,"""I'm Different""",2 Chainz,https://genius.com/2-chainz-im-different-lyrics,"Yeah
Yeah
2 Chainz
Mustard on the beat, ho!
I'm different, yeah, I'm different
I'm different, yeah, I'm different
I'm different, yeah, I'm different
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing
Middle finger up to my competition
I'm different, yeah, I'm different 
I'm different, yeah, I'm different 
I'm different, yeah, I'm different 
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing
Pull up to the scene, but my roof gone 
When I leave the scene, bet your boo gone 
And I beat the pussy like a new song 
2 Chainz, but I got me a few on
 
Everything hot, skip lukewarm 
Tell shawty bust it open, Uncle Luke on
Got the present for the present and a gift wrapping
I don't feel good, but my trigger happy 
Bet the stripper happy, bet they wish they had me
And I wish a nigga would, like a kitchen cabinet
And me and you are cut from a different fabric
I fucked her so good, it's a bad habit 
Bitch, sit down, you got a bad atti'
Gave her the wrong number and a bad addy 
You ain't going nowhere like a bad navi'
Ass so big, I told her to look back at it 
Look back at it , look back at it 
Then I put a fat rabbit on the Craftmatic
I am so high ... attic
I am so high, like a ... addict
I'm different, yeah, I'm different
I'm different, yeah, I'm different
I'm different, yeah, I'm different
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing
Middle finger up to my competition
I'm different, yeah, I'm different
I'm different, yeah, I'm different 
I'm different, yeah, I'm different 
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing
2 Chainz, got your girl on the celly
And when I get off the celly, I made her meet at the telly
When she meet at the telly, I put it straight in her belly
When it go in the belly, it ain't shit you can tell me, ugh 
Hair long , money long 
Me and broke niggas, we don't get along 
Hair long , money long 
Me and broke niggas, we don't get along 
I paid a thousand dollars for my sneakers
'Ye told you, a 100K for a feature
""Ee-err, ee-err"": sound of the bed 
Beat it up, beat it up; then, I get some head 
Well, I might get some head; then, I beat it up
I don't give a fuck, switch it up, nigga, live it up 
Yeah, it's going down, so get up 
Might valet-park a Brinks truck 
Mustard on the beat, ho!
I'm different, yeah, I'm different
I'm different, yeah, I'm different
I'm different, yeah, I'm different
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing
Middle finger up to my competition
I'm different, yeah, I'm different
I'm different, yeah, I'm different
I'm different, yeah, I'm different
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing"
100,"""Still Into You""",Paramore,https://genius.com/Paramore-still-into-you-lyrics,"Can't count the years on one hand that we've been together
I need the other one to hold you
Make you feel, make you feel better
It's not a walk in the park to love each other
But when our fingers interlock
Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it
'Cause after all this time
I'm still into you
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you 
And, baby, even on our worst nights
I'm into you 
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time
I'm still into you
Recount the night that I first met your mother
And on the drive back to my house
I told you that, I told you that I loved ya
You felt the weight of the world fall off your shoulder
And to your favorite song
We sang along to the start of forever
And after all this time
I'm still into you
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you 
And, baby, even on our worst nights
I'm into you 
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time
I'm still into you
Some things just, some things just make sense
And one of those is you and I 
Some things just, some things just make sense
And even after all this time 
I'm into you
Baby, not a day goes by that I'm not into you
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you 
And, baby, even on our worst nights
I'm into you 
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time
I'm still into you
I'm still into you
I'm still into you"
