run away
 with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we 
fell into
 a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (
You're the 
moonlight

I need you all night, 
come on
, dance with me
I'm levitating
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

Na-na, yeah
I saw you dancing in a crowded room 
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day 
I made you think that I would always stay
I said some things that I should never say
Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
And now you won't love me for a second time
I don't know why I run away, oh, girl
Said, I make you cry when I run away
Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that I'm much too late
And you deserve someone better
Save your tears for another day 
Save your tears for another day 
I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away
Save your tears for another day

I've been on my own for long enough

I'm goin' through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty 
No one's around to judge me 
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh
The city's cold and empty 
No one's around to judge me 
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
I'm just calling back to let you know

I just want your company
Girl, it's obvious, 
elephant in the room
And we're a part of it, don't act so confused

Now we arguin' in my bedroom
We play games of love to avoid the depression
We been here before and I won't be a victim

When you could be blowin' up just like my cellular?
I won't ever let a shorty go and set me up
Only thing I need to know is if you wet enough
I'm talkin' slick back, kick back, 
gang sippin' forties

Mismatched fits, that was way before you know me
Got a lot of love, well, you better save it for me

You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl 
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you
Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want 
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off 
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? 
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you
Maybe I'm too emotional
But your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe I'm too emotional
Your apathy is like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask

We could kiss and just cut the rubbish
Then I might bе onto somethin'
I ain't givin' you one in public
I'm givin' you hundreds, fuck it
Somethin' we just gotta get into
Sign first, middle, last on the wisdom tooth
Niggas wishin' that the pussy was a kissin' booth
Taste breakfast, lunch, and gin and juice
And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh, give me two
When I bite that lip, come get me too
He want lipstick, lip gloss, hickeys too, huh
Can you kiss me more?

All my bitches feel like I dodged the county
Fuckin' with you feel like jail, nigga 
I can't even exhale, nigga 
Pussy like holy grail, you know that 
You gon' make me need bail, you know that
Caught dippin' with your friend
You ain't even half, man, lyin' on your ****, you know that
Got me a bag full of brick, you know that
Control, don't slow the pace if I throw back
All this ass for real 
Drama make you feel 
Fantasy and whip appeal is all I can give you

Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you
And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe 
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe 
I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone

Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin’ 'bout how small it looks on you
Watching reruns of 
Glee
Bein' annoying, singin’ in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu?  Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?
Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her ""Uptown Girl""
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse 
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it’s all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the songs she's singing now when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? 
Do you get déjà vu?
Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to do
Play her piano, but she doesn't know 
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel 
A different girl now, but there's nothing new
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu"

A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long
When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all
The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good
'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all
After all"

I ain't lost since I began, yeah
Funny how you said it was the end, yeah
Then I went did it again, yeah
I told you long ago on the road
I got what they waiting for 
I don't run from nothing, dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em I ain't layin' low 
You was never really rooting for me anyway 
When I'm back up at the top, I wanna hear you say 
He don't run from nothin', dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em that the break is over 
My track record so clean, they couldn't wait to just bash me
I must be gettin' too flashy, y'all shouldn't have let the world gas me 
It's too late 'cause I'm here to stay and these girls know that I'm nasty 
I sent her back to her boyfriend with my handprint on her ass cheek
City talkin', we takin' notes
Tell 'em all to keep makin' posts
Wish he could, but he can't get close
OG so proud of me that he chokin' up while he makin' toasts
I'm the type that you can't control, said I would, then I made it so
I don't clear up rumors , where's y'all sense of humor? 
I'm done makin' jokes 'cause they got old like baby boomers
Turned my haters to consumers, I make vets feel like they juniors 
Say your time is comin' soon, but just like Oklahoma 
Mine is comin' sooner , I'm just a late bloomer 
I didn't peak in high school, I'm still out here gettin' cuter 
All these social networks and computers
Got these pussies walkin' 'round like they ain't losers
I told you long ago on the road
I got what they waiting for 
I don't run from nothing, dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em I ain't layin' low 
You was never really rooting for me anyway
When I'm back up at the top, I wanna hear you say
He don't run from nothin', dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em that the break is over
Yeah
I'm the industry baby, mmm
I'm the industry baby
Yeah"

Tell that bitch back back, breath smell like horse sex 
Put it on him now, he will never be the same 
Tatted on my ass 'cause I really like the pain 
He nutted on my butt, I said, ""I'm glad that you came""

When we pull up to the scene, they be filled with jealousy
If a bitch get finicky, she gon' bring that energy

Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished
Uh, I won't love a ho, after we fuck, she can't get near me
Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri
My pants Amiri, yes, I'm winnin', clearly
I'm the chosen one, seen my potential, so they fear me
Lately I've been prayin', God, I wonder, can You hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up, I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely
I've been gettin' high to hide behind my insecurities
Takin' different pills, but I know it ain't gon'—

So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it 
And we might have a child when I'm finished
They say I'm Pac rebirth, never put out a weak verse
Homicides when we lurk, 
I'ma step 'til my feet hurt
Been puttin' them streets first
White tees turned burgundy t-shirts
Lookin' for somethin' real, he stuck in a deep search
Anxiety killin' me, I just want to leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Try and explain your feelings, sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the fuck—, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar for every battle I fought
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'

You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories
And black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk
And fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like one day you'll come back to me
Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on
Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'еm back
I'm in love with the past
And now we liе awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes
Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, ay
Makin' beautiful mistakes
It's pitiful, I can't believe
How every day gets worse for me
I take a break, I cut you off
To keep myself from lookin' soft
I fill my nights with the way you was
And still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality
Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

Makin' beautiful mistakes
You did me wrong 'cause I let you 
Usually, I like my situations beneficial
Doin' somethin' different, got me lookin' stupid 
The only way I'm comin' back to you is if you dreamin' lucid 
Prove it, if you made a promise then keep it 
Why you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it 
But really, I was doin' just fine without ya
Lookin' fine, sippin' wine, dancin' on club couches 
Baby, why you wanna lose me like you don't need me? 
Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me 
How you figure out how to call me from the TV? 
You runnin' outta chances and this time I mean it 
Yeah, bet you miss my love, all in your bed 
Now you're stressin' out, pullin' your hair 
Smellin' your pillows and wishin' I was there 
Slidin' down the shower wall, lookin' sad 
I know it's hard to let go, I'm the best 
Best you ever had and best you gon' get 
And if we break up, I don't wanna be friends 
You're toxic
Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake
Making' beautiful mistakes

Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's makin' me say
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
I don't do well with the drama
And, no, I can't stand it being fake
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me

The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you, bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud 
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds 
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud 
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up 
Formalize the union in communion, He can trust 
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us 
I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so ho-ho-ho-holy"

Keep a certified hitter sittin', I pay him not to rob
Hop out 2020 Cullinan, I'm ridin' in the stars
Know some people hate that I'm on top, I bulletproofed the car
All the members made free bands off packs, live like they crackin' cards
Joe know for a fact I keep it real, he still ain't take the charge
Why she talkin' crazy 'bout me like I don't do more than my part?
I can't play with my creation, give the world to my lil' boys
I been savin' more than I been spendin', that's what I bе on

Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex
I told brodie 'nem to park the car, but they still wrecked
I don't think nobody around steal, but I still check
I don't got a hundred mil' yet, I can't chill yet
But don't get it misconstrued, yeah, I get real checks
Baby fuckin' like a pornstar, we have real sex
Have nobody in our business, we take Learjets
Say she like when I perform, so I fuck her with my chains on
And she handlin' her part, so I let her play the main role
Ain't have to get rich for these partners, still with the same folks
And I can't beef with none of you niggas, not in the same boat
I'm never gon' get caught up about it, know how the game go
Tennis chain bustin', look like rainbows

Show her off like she's a new trophy
And I know if you were true, there's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly
And ain't it funny? All the twisted games
All the questions you used to avoid

Than a lot more things that I've ever done, I probably should pick that cup back up 
I'm sittin' here lookin' at Keisha, like, ""Do you love me, do you love me not?""
Damn, you hit the spot
Taste like candy , sweet like fruit 
Wet like water, can I love on you?
Withdrawals, I'm feelin' different, every day I need a dose
Every now and thеn I'm missin', I got my times when I go ghost
But she minе , I'm stampin' her
Priority status, so them other bitches mad at her 
Thumbin' through a hunnid thou', I spent that times two on you
Caught myself cuttin' you loose, then I pop back up like peekaboo
Here I go, flyer than most, Louis V coat
Gas station, coffee cup full, I don't drive boats, no
Money can't buy happiness but she found love inside a G
Head and somethin' to eat, that's all a thug nigga need
No lie you get me higher than the prices on my weed
I'm displayin' my feelings like I'm wearing 'em on my sleeve

Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached

Sippin' chaser with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha

In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup 
Ring around the rose-z, cup full of OZ's
I hope I don't OD, she keep sayin', ""Pour me""
Turn me to that purple demon emoji 
Fuck me like you miss me, it's been a whole week
This ain't no playground love, we grown 
I'm too fucked up, I paid four hunnid for a zone 
My bitch don't like you, you've been fuckin' up my home 
Relapsin' every time I try to leave you 'lone 
Every nigga in the street lookin' for her but she rare
Dark skin, purple hair, stingy, with her hard to share 
Never needed nobody but it feel good to have somebody 
Drop you and pick you up whenever I feel like it
This shit toxic
Let me know if you feel me, hmm-hmm 
I gotta stop it, I must stop it
One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached

I know your man, he ain't controllin' you
But you still hesitate 
'Cause you choose loyalty 
And I know your history 
Met him before your peak 
He's so connected to that woman that you used to be
But-but-but this sex will cloud your memory
A couple strokes to put it in, then you'll belong to me
[Pre-Chorus: Doja Cat & 
The Weeknd
]
I got a man, but I want you
I got a man, but I want you (
Oh
)
And it's just nerves, it's just dick
Makin' me think 'bout someone new
You know I got so much to say
I try to hide it in my face
And it don't work, you see through
That I just wanna get with you
 
And you're right
You right, I 
Got my guy 
But I, I 
Can't help it, I want you
Said you right, I 
Got my guy 
But I, I 
Can't help it, I want you"

Can't be takin' L's, mama said I was a winner
Lord forgive me, I'm a sinner
I do things I didn't mean to
Got a shorty by my side, sike, I don't think I need her
Thuggin' in my Reeboks
Ridin' wit a G-Shock
I heard he shot
Draco make a beat box
OG made that sharp turn, Woadie spot 'em, peeled the car
Had a mask on, Draco make 'em beat box
I got my crew by my side
Don't need no bodyguard
Bitch you can't talk to me
From the hood, too hard
Shoot your king
Headshot
Call it a discard
Shit, we turn wherever you at
To a bomb yard
On and off the court
You finna get this work
Got your bitch on my dick
Finna make her twerk
Turn your whole hood gay
Turn it to a jerk circ
Comin' off crazy
Off a muhfuckin' perc

But I ain't talkin' no free throw
Put an opp inside an oven
Shit's a heatbox
I'm tryna skrt off in a foreign
Ain't talkin' no Nissan

And swipin' cards like Visa

Talkin' to me funny watch your head
We finna spazz out
Bad lil shorty talkin' to me nice

Thuggin' in a Maserati

Freezin' from the ice all on me
Cocaine like Lysol on me
Fuck with the gang and you getting the work
You don't got meat on you like salami
Take your chances, fuck with me
Go and roll your dice all on me

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?
Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy
Shawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy
I've seen some niggas attack and don't end up makin' it back
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby

I'm in the trenches, relax
Can you not play that lil' boy in the club? 'Cause we do not listen to rats
We in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me Tae is the best
Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the 'net
I'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon' get stretched
Ooh-oh
Bring Drake to the hood, surround Drake around Dracs
Even though I got a case, I'ma do what it take
And I never been embraced
And the money's hard to make
So I bet they on they face right now
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?
When he tell the story, that's not how it went
Know they be lyin', a hundred percent
Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'
Valet just called me to tell me come get it
Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah
Heart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'
Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea
And then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it
It's hard to believe it
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby

Leave me out the comments, leave me out the nonsense
Speakin' out of context, people need some content
Niggas tryna keep up, shit is not a contest
Whippin' Benz concept
Heaven-sent, God-sent
Least that's what my mom says
Proof is in the progress, money's not a object
Busy than a motherfucker, you know how my job get
Barkin' up the wrong tree, you know how the dogs get
Haven't fallen off yet, yee
Come with a classic, they come around years later and say it's a sleeper
The earrings are real, the petty is real, might charge my ex for a feature
Deposit the money to Brenda, LaTisha, or Linda, Felicia
She came for me twice, I didn't even nut for her once, you know I'm a pleaser
Forty-two millimeter, was made in Geneva
Yeah, I probably should go to Yeshiva, we went to Ibiza
Yeah, I probably should go link with Yeezy, I need me some Jesus
But soon as I started confessin' my sins, he wouldn't believe us
Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love with two girls at one time
And they tens, that's why I got ten on my mind
I got M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
Should repent, I need me some Jesus in my life
Amen
I'm from the four, but I love me a threesome
DM her, delete it, she my lil' secret
He tryna diss me to blow up, I peep it
I can't respond, we just go at your people
If I left some racks on the bed, you can keep it
This shit gettin' deeper and deeper, I dig it
My shovel wasn't bent, I was broke, had to fix it
A shark in the water, you swim with the lil' fishes
I hit today, by tomorrow, she miss it
I grab her neck, she look up, then I kiss it
I'm not a GOAT, but I fit the description
I like to pour, so I get the prescription
We walk around with them bands in our britches
This gun ain't gon' jam, when I blow, I ain't missin'
I'm droppin' hit after hit, I'm just chillin'
But I'll send a hit while I chill with my children
Bigger the business, the bigger the office
I fucked 'round and found me a swag, then I caught up
They call for my artists, they makin' me offers
I don't even bargain, I'll start from the bottom
I lost a Ferrari, Las Vegas, Nevada
I woke up the followin' day and went harder
I'm crackin' my shell now, they see that I'm smarter
I gotta get money, I love to get charter
I gave her four Birkins and one's for her daughter 
I can't let 'em down, walk around with my guard up
I'm screamin' out ""YOLO,"" yeah, that's still the motto
I know I be on some shit that they ain't thought of
Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind

I'm in love, I'm in love with two girls at one time

Get some air now, let yo edge out
Too soon, I spoke
You be heavy in my mind, can you get the heck out?
I need rest now, got me bummed out
You so, you so, you
Baby, baby, babe
I've been on my empty mind shit
I try to keep from losin' the rest of me
I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, ""Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent""
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me
[Chorus: SZA, 
Jacob Collier

Both

All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in
Good days
, good days, always
Always inside (
Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind
)
Good day living in my mind
[Verse 2: SZA, 
Jacob Collier

Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations
I disappear if you let me
Feelin' like, yeah (
On your own

Feelin' like Jericho
Feelin' like Job when he lost his shit
Gotta hold my own,
 
my cross to bear alone, I
Ooh, played and dipped, way to kill the mood
Know you like that shit
Can't groove it, ba-baby
Heavy on my empty mind shit
I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me 
Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care

Sunny inside (
Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind

Good day living in my mind
Gotta get right
Tryna free my mind before the end of the world
I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text
I choose not to respond
I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened
Half of us layin' waste to our youth, it's in the present
Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now
Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind
You've been making me feel like I'm
Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind"

To a better place than the one we're at
And I ain't got no kinda plan
But I've had all of this town I can stand
And I got friends out on the coast
We can jump in the water and see what floats
We've been savin' for a rainy day
Let's beat the storm and be on our way
And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And, honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice
I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over
This might not be an easy time
There's rivers to cross and hills to climb
Some days, we might fall apart
And some nights might feel cold and dark
But nobody wins afraid of losin'
And the hard roads are the ones worth choosin'
Someday, we'll look back and smile
And know it was worth every mile
And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And, honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice
I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over

Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man

Coke cans and BB guns
, barbed wire and old fence posts
8-point bucks in autumn and freshly cut cornfields
One arm out the window and one hand on the wheel
Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say, ""I love you, too"" is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove
Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
Sometimes we're oil and water
But I wouldn't have it any other way
And if I'm being honest
Your first and my last name
Would just sound better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?

So you wanna be riding around with your new bitch
That's real cute
Don't have me drag you and her out that motherfuckin' car

And you know what? I just got tickets to the Lakers game anyway
Nigga, you could never
If I ever made you angry, girl
Just know that it get better with time 
They say time heals
She can't see her life without me, she's so blind still
Fuck that nigga, you can tell him that you're mines still
And she don't wanna go to sleep, she angry
Lately, she's been noticing hе ain't me
I wish that we can change placеs
Don't want no new, new faces
She got my heartbeat racing
They say time heals
Don't go build no life without me 'cause you're mines still
Oh, and I don't wanna go unless you make me
Lately I've been gone, I'm feeling crazy
Yeah, I'm from the bricks, we gotta whole lot of bricks
You gotta whole lotta tricks and I wanna see what you do with them
I just saw you in Miami, girl, what you doing here?
I hope you with your girlfriends
I ain't pay attention to your heart, I played ya
Now she fell in love with an NBA player
Had her on the stage, now she ballin at the stadium
Matter fact I hope you stay with him
'Cause I don't wanna go unless you take me
I know you feel the pain
And she don't wanna go to sleep, she angry
Lately, she's been noticing he ain't me
I wish that we can change places
Don't want no new, new faces
She got my heartbeat racing
They say time heals
Don't go build no life without me 'cause you're mine still
And I don't wanna go unless you make me
Down on my knees hoping you take me
Better tell that nigga you mine
Heard you've been trying to tie the knot, girl, tell me you lyin'
Let me beat that pussy up one more time
Let me beat that pussy up one more time
I know that you fiend for this

'Cause 'round here, it's all about the people that you know
And I've got some famous friends you've probably never heard of
But back in Davidson County, our crowd is second to none
You might not know 'em here in this big city we're in
But when I go back home, I've got some famous friends
Yeah, I do

Why the fuck you in the club when niggas wildin’?

I've been lit since brunch, thot shit
Order '42 for the table, let’s pop shit
Missionary or doggystyle, I'ma top shit
Pussy-ass niggas hatin' on me from the closet, ah
Hoes tryna call me a snake, shit, I guess I can relate
'Cause a bitch spit a whole lotta venom
And since these hoes all rats, when they come around me
All I see is a whole lotta dinner
I walk around the house butt-naked
And I stop at every mirror just to stare at my own posterior
I don't give a fuck who talk behind my back
'Cause the bitch knew better than to let me hear her

He got a girl, but he keep beggin' to see me
I love it when a nigga got a mouth full of VVs
No, I'm not a patient, but I let him treat me
I gotta be a doctor how I’m orderin' CCs
Go to your place, no face, no case
Ninety-nine percent tint in a blacked-out Wraith
I remember hoes used to clap for me happily
Now I'm bossed up and them same hoes mad at me
Acting like they ridin', whole time tryna pass me
Watchin' me go through it and still tryna drag me
Actin' like you winnin', if you think about it, actually
Are they supportin' you or really just attackin' me?
I don't give a fuck 'bout a blog tryna bash me

Everything I eat go straight to my pockets
2021, finna graduate college
Goth girl shit, I'm a real hot topic
Fuckin' on a nigga, make him sing, on some pop shit
I need a real headbanger, on some rock shit
Pussy like crack, wanna hit it like dope
Got a real hot box, but a bitch don't smoke 
Hot girl, but I'm still the coldest, hey
I'm the big homie, but I ain't the oldest, hmm
Bitch dry hatin', tryna get noticed
Man, ain't nobody come to see you, Otis, look
How many bitches lyin' if they say they bars is better?
They really puppets, so I really gotta go and Geppetto
I'm really talkin', but it really can apply to whoever
My pen a freak, it'll go after a bitch or a nigga 
Big bank take lil' bank, bitch, add it up
Hoes takin' shots, but they ain't in my caliber
Booked, but I squeeze a lil' head in my calendar
Lookin' in the mirror like, ""Damn, I don't brag enough""
LVs, double C's, Birkins, I'm workin'
My chain ain't hittin' if a bitch ain't hurtin'
Look, I ain't even finna argue with a bitch
One thing I know, two things for certain
None of these hoes sayin' shit to my face
And none of these hoes finna see me at the bank
And I'ma keep talkin' all the shit that I want
And I dare one of these hoes come tell me I can't
We ain't even speakin' if the nigga ain't spendin'
He could never say that I was one of his women
I don't even let niggas know where I stay
I'll be damned if he thinkin' he poppin' up on this pimpin'

Are you on the Chattahoochee
On a barefoot blue jean night

Everybody got a story to tell
Everybody got a hallelujah

Tell me which one hits you, baby
Yeah, what's your country song?
Yeah, what's your country song?
Do your exes live in Texas?
Are you so lonesome you could cry?
Are you heart-broke 'cause you know
That ain't your truck in her drive?
Are your friends all in low places
Underneath the neon moon
?
Were you already country
Back when country wasn't cool?
Everybody got a small town anthem
Everybody got a story to tell
Everybody got a hallelujah
Everybody been through a little hell
When you're rolling down a two-lane highway
And you turn your radio on
Tell me which one hits you, baby
Yeah, what's your country song?
Yeah, what's your country song?
Who's your strawberry wine?
What's your family tradition?
What makes you turn it up?
Makes you raise your cup every time you listen?

Everybody been through a little hell

I got addicted to a losing game

'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah

95,"""Single Saturday Night""",Cole Swindell,https://genius.com/Cole-swindell-single-saturday-night-lyrics,"I was out taking shots
Throwing down at the spot
Three sheets, just me and the guys
Every single Saturday night
I was killing time, crushing cans
Trying not to catch a tan
'Cause I was under them neon lights
Every single Saturday night, yeah
Everybody knew they could find me there
And right out of the blue, right out of nowhere
Out of nowhere
Sittin’ over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips, working on a White Claw
Shakin' to a little “Shook Me All Night Long”
And I thought, ""Man, what a beautiful sight""
Ain't a mornin’ you don't wake up in my shirt now
Even holding hands walkin' out of church now
Who'd of thought, baby, looking back that
That would be my last single Saturday night?
Yeah
My last single Saturday night
And now when I'm out, havin' a drink or two
If they see me, huh, they see you
'Cause, girl, I got you by my side
Every single Saturday night, yeah
Every now and then, the boys tell me they miss me
Oh but they all get it 'cause they were right there with me
Yeah with me, when
Sittin’ over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips, working on a White Claw
Shakin’ to a little, “Shook Me All Night Long”
And I thought, ""Man, what a beautiful sight""
Ain't a morning you don’t wake up in my shirt now
Even holding hands walkin' out of church now
Who'd of thought, baby, looking back that
That would be my last single Saturday night?
The last time that I'd buy a drink for a girl I’d never met before
I wasn't looking for love when I walked through the door
But damn if I didn't find what I wasn't even looking for
Sittin' over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips, working on a White Claw
Shakin' to a little “Shook Me All Night Long”
And I thought, ""Man, what a beautiful sight""
Ain't a morning you don't wake up in my shirt now
Look at us even pickin' out a church now
Who'd of thought, baby, looking back that
That would be my last single Saturday night?
Yeah
My last single Saturday night"

How to stay when it's tough
How to know you're messin' up a good thing
And how to fix it 'fore it's too late
And yeah, I know a boy
Who gave up and got it wrong
If you really love a woman, you don't let her go
Yeah, I know a few things a man oughta know
If I can't have it, I can do without
I can hang a picture same as I can take it down
And how to keep it hidden when a heart gets broke

This life had left me so scarred, I'm knowing that's true
Remember times got so hard, I got it tattoed

I'll keep on running, nigga 
If wе go down bad, keep it a hundred, nigga

I promise I'll be here when I can get some time
Right now, I got to get what's mine 
I'll be thuggin' 'til the end of time

Even though it's a Friday night
Church found me
Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, amen

When the world's gone crazy, man, it all makes sense

Little peace of mind from a cold one

El viento soba tu cabello
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Me matan esos ojos bellos
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Me gusta tu olor, de tu piel el color
Y cómo me haces sentir
Me gusta tu boquita, ese labial rosita
Y cómo me besas a mí 
Contigo quiero despertar
Hacerlo después de fumar 
Ya no tengo na' que buscar
Algo fuera de aquí
Tú combinas con el mar
Ese bikini se ve fenomenal
No hay gravedad que me pueda elevar
Me pones mal a mí 
Aceleras to’ mis latidos
Y e' que me gusta todo de ti
De toa' tus parte’, ¿cuál decido?
Y e' que me gusta todo de ti
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Y e' que me gusta todo de ti
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Y e' que me gusta todo de ti
Quinta Avenida, no va pa'l mall
Ella sabe que le llego a solo un call
En la Raptor me gusta ponerla en four
El jogger large, la camisa small
Como la dieta keto
Por ti, me controlo y me quedo quieto
Aunque quiero comerte to' eso completo
De ese culo me volví un teco, eh
Mi-Mi-Micro dosi', rola, oxi
Besando eso' labio’ glossy
Ya yo le di en to’a la' posi
Champú de coco, Chanel su wallet
Me vuelve loco desde el casco hasta lo’ pedale'
