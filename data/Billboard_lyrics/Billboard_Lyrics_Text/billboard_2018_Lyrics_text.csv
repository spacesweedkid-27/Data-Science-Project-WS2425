Yeah
I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me

You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
I don't wanna die for them to miss me
Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me

I hold back, sometimes I won't, yeah
I feel good, sometimes I don't 
I finessed down Weston Road 
Might go down a G-O-D

2,"""Perfect""",Ed Sheeran,https://genius.com/Ed-sheeran-perfect-lyrics,"I found a love for me
Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darlin', just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, ""Darlin', you look perfect tonight""
Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darlin', just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darlin', you look perfect tonight
No, no, no
Mm, no, no
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
We're barefoot on the grass, oh, listenin' to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met
An angel in person and she looks perfect
I don't deserve this, you look perfect tonight"

I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar 
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta 
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas 
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grra-ta-ta-ta 
Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', ""Rest in peace to Bon Scott"" 
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison 
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car 
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', ""I'm with the band"" 
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend 
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar 
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta 
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas 
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grra-ta-ta-ta 
I've been in the Hills fuckin' superstars
Feelin' like a popstar 
Drankin' Henny, bad bitches jumpin' in the pool
And they ain't got on no bra 
Hit her from the back, pullin' on her tracks
And now she screamin' out, ""¡No más!"" 
They like, ""Savage, why you got a twelve car garage
And you only got six cars?"" 
I ain't with the cakin', how you kiss that? 
Your wifey say I'm lookin' like a whole snack 
Green hundreds in my safe, I got old racks 
L.A. bitches always askin', ""Where the coke at?"" 
Livin' like a rockstar, smash out on a cop car
Sweeter than a Pop-Tart, you know you are not hard
I done made the hot chart, 'member I used to trap hard
Livin' like a rockstar, I'm livin' like a rockstar (

Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, ayy
Know that I been with the shits ever since a jit, ayy

30 for a walkthrough, man, we had that bitch lit, ayy
Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'
And I'm like ""Woah, man, my neck so goddamn cold”
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked

Boolin' with a thot-thot, she gon' give me top-top
Just one switch, I can make the ass drop 
Ayy, take you to the smoke shop
We gon' get high, ayy, we gon' hit Rodeo
Dial up Valentino, we gon' hit Pico
Take you where I'm from, take you to the slums
This ain't happen overnight, no, these diamonds real bright

Stars on the roof, they're matching with the jewelry

No-no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead 
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache 
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache 
You made my heart break 
You made my heart ache 
You made my heart break again 
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you

Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life, it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it's gonna take 
Another foreign or a bigger chain 
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh, damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
 This ain't for the best

My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten, but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, ""Look up,"" 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man, you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D.​
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me
Brand-new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like, ""Yes, indeed""
Cartier glasses, I won't even peek at you
Yellow Ferrari like Pikachu
I got 'em waitin' and watchin' what he gon' do
Tryna peep what I do, tryna steal my moves
Twenty-five hundred for a new pair of tennis shoes
The same price, I could make them youngins come and finish you
Lawyer been chargin', he a Jewish like he voodoo
Real dope boy, hundred thousand in Evisu
Presidential tints slide by, we don't see you
I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout what he do
I'm gettin' money like I'm from the eighties
Me and Drake 'bout to drop, man, this shit gon' go crazy
They know I'm the truth, comin' straight from the basement
I'm straight as the street, man, I come from the pavement
A million, all hundreds, it make 'em go crazy

There's a guy that lives in the Garden State
And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that we're meant to be
But jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best of me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause
I'm bad at love 
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one 
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love
Got a girl with California eyes
And I thought that she could really be the one this time
But I never got the chance to make her mine
Because she fell in love with little thin white lines
London girl with a attitude
We never told no one, but we look so cute
Both got way better things to do
But I always think about her when I'm ridin' through
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that I'm in too deep
And jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best in me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah

Coulda made this work

Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now
Sit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen
I mean, why are you laughing?
Must have missed that joke, let me see if I can find a reaction
No, but at least you're happy

Turn around and hit it from the back, back, back
Bend her down then I make it clap, clap, clap
I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no
Draco got that kick-back when I blow that, they all do track
They don't shoot back, one shot, close range, red dot
Head tight, yeah, I did that, yeah, I live that
Call a Uber with my shooter, with a Ruger, we gon' do ya
Niggas say they killin' people, but I really fuckin' do it
I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no
He-he tryna 69 like Tekashi, call him papi
Word to A$AP, keep me Rocky, I'm from New York, so I'm cocky
Say he fuckin' with my posse, copped me Khloé like Kardashi'
Keep this pussy in Versace, said I'm pretty like Tinashe
Put-put it all up in his face, did I catch a case?
Pussy game just caught a body, but I never leave a trace
Face is pretty, ass for days, I get chips, I ask for Lay's
I just sit back and when he done, I be like, ""Yo, how'd it taste?""
I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no
Ayo, Draco got that kick-back
When it kick-back, you can't get yo shit back
In fact this that bitch that
""I hate small talk, I don't fuck with chit-chat""
AC just stopped workin'
So they hit me, told me bring my wrist back
Come through rockin' fashions
That got all these bitches like, ""Yo, what's that?""

Think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf
In case my little baby girl is in need
Am I coming out of left field?
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
I been feeling it since 1966 now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
Let me kick it like it's 1986 now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Got another mouth to feed
Leave it with a babysitter, mama, call the gravedigger
Gone with the fallen leaves
Am I coming out of left field?
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
I been feeling it since 1966 now
Might've had your fill, but you feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
Let me kick it like it's 1986 now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
We could fight a war for peace
Give in to that easy living
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Start flipping for my enemies
Or we could wait until the walls come down
It's time to give a little to the kids in the middle
But, oh, until it falls, won't bother me
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming back?
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, yeah
Your love is an abyss for my heart to eclipse now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

34,"""MotorSport""","Migos, Nicki Minaj and Cardi B",https://genius.com/Genius-russia-how-to-add-song-credits-to-genius-annotated,"Что такое кре́дитсы?
Это список музыкантов, принимавших участие в создании песни. Они делятся на следующие категории:
Primary Artists:
 Исполнитель, от имени которого вышла песня. Кредитсы Genius должны строго соответствовать данным со стриминговых сервисов, прежде всего Apple Music. Если там главный исполнитель представлен списком из нескольких артистов , то и вам в поле «Primary Artists» нужно сгруппировать имена всех исполнителей в одну запись, затем через функцию «Add Additional Credits» создать поле «Primary Artists» и уже там указать имя каждого из исполнителей по отдельности.
Исключением являются «супергруппы» — музыкальные коллективы, собранные из уже состоявшихся артистов. На стриминговых сервисах их названия часто дополняют именами участников . Для упрощения оставьте только название группы.
Writers:
 В поле авторов указывают людей, которые участвовали в создании песни: причём к ним относятся как авторы музыки, так и авторы слов.
Featured Artists:
 Приглашённые исполнители — это артисты, которые сделали значительный вклад в создание песни. Как правило, своим вокалом или соавторством.
Producers
: Тут имеются в виду продюсеры музыки. В хип-хопе чаще всего это человек, написавший бит.
Additional Credits:
 Этот раздел охватывает всех остальных профессионалов, сделавших вклад в создание песни: сюда входят музыканты, игравшие на определенных инструментах, звукорежиссёры и т.д.
Когда нужно/нельзя добавлять кредитсы?
Добавлять данные на Genius можно, 
ТОЛЬКО
 если они были предоставлены официально. Это значит, что:
Заполнять кредитсы на основе собственных домыслов строго запрещено
Будьте готовы в любой момент предъявить авторитетный источник, подтверждающий ваши кредитсы
Чтобы не засорять дискографии исполнителей, никогда не заполняйте кредитсы для страниц следующего типа:
Переводы песен
Фанатские мэшапы
Неофициальные ремиксы
Неофициально изданные каверы
Песни, созданные с помощью искусственного интеллекта 
Где искать кредитсы
Буклет альбома:
 На разворотах буклетов большинства физических носителей  размещают кредитсы. При покупке цифровой версии альбома подобные буклеты иногда прилагаются в электронном виде.
Общества по защите авторских прав:
 Это организации, помогающие исполнителям получать отчисления за их музыкальные произведения. Чтобы авторское общество знало, кому выплачивать деньги, авторы регистрируют свои песни в реестре этого общества. 
—> 
Как искать кредитсы на сайтах авторских обществ
Стриминговые сервисы:
 Такие стриминги, как Spotify, Apple Music, TIDAL 
 хранят кредитсы у себя в метаданных. 
—> 
Как искать кредитсы на стриминговых сервисах
Социальные медиа:
 Информацию об авторах песен нередко предоставляют авторитетные СМИ и даже сами исполнители у себя в соцсетях. Её можно использовать в качестве кредитсов, если источник заслуживает доверия.
Прочие сайты:
 Профессиональные сайты по сбору музыкальных метаданных, вроде AllMusic или Discogs, вполне подходят в качестве источников. Краудсорсинговые сайты, вроде Википедии, можно использовать в качестве справочных материалов, но информация оттуда требует подкрепления дополнительными ресурсами.
Перечень музыкальных профессий и их принятое написание
Одна и та же музыкальная профессия в разных источниках может именоваться немного по-разному, поэтому мы разработали собственный перечень с названиями музыкантов. При заполнении кредистов обращайтесь к нему, чтобы выбрать форму написания, принятую у нас на сайте. Обратите внимание, что в списке перечислены только часто используемые кредитсы. Если кредитс, который вы хотите указать, не добавляется, обратитесь к 
редакторам или модераторам
 за помощью. При заполнении кредитсов помните, что у каждой роли 
должно быть отдельное поле.
Для каждой из музыкальных профессий в списке ниже в скобках указан русский перевод. При заполнении данных перевод указывать не нужно — используйте только название на английском.

Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up

An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee

You can break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
Won't lie, I'd go back to you
You know, my thoughts are runnin' loose
It's just a thing you make me do
And I could fight, but what's the use?
I know I'd go back to you
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to 
When I'm lyin' close to someone else 
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
 
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you
I'll go back to you

This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot (

Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 a.m. and I'm back up poppin' with the crew

Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

Told her, ""Hop in, you comin' too""
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke

Don't stop, pop that pussy!

Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, ""Where we goin'?"" I said, ""The moon""

Wouldn't see the point of living on if one of us died, yeah
Uh, got that kind of style everybody try to rip off
YSL dress under when she takes the mink off
Silk on her body, pull it down and watch it slip off
Ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my **** (
Hahaha

Crazy, but I love her, I could never run from her
Hit it, no rubber never would let no one touch her
Swear we drive each other mad, she be so stubborn
But what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer?
Intense, this shit, it gets dense
She knows when I'm out of it like she could just sense
If I had a million dollars or was down to ten cents
She'd be down for whatever, never gotta convince, you know?

But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less l love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad, but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes 
I'm way too good at goodbyes 
No way that you'll see me cry 
I'm way too good at goodbyes , no
No, no, no, no, no 
No, no, no, no
No, no, no 
Ah-ah, ah-ah 
'Cause every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad, but it's true

Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months
What bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, ""Goals,"" bitch, I'm who they tryna be

I might just chill with your boo, I might just feel on your babe
My pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, ""Okay""
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse
I got the trunk in the front 
I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill

If you a pussy, you get popped, you a goofy, you a opp
Don't you come around my way, you can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter is gold, tell that lil' bitch play her role
I just arrove in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot

Care for me, care for me, care for me, uh
Yeah, look
I wanna get married, like the Currys, Steph and Ayesha shit
But we more like 
Belly, 
Tommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you woulda learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though? Trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I coulda did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
You make me sick, nigga
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me 
Do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me
Care for me, care for me
Always said that you'd be there for me, there for me
Boy, you better treat me carefully, carefully, look
I was here before all of this
Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this lust got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stopped so abrupt, you started switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me 
Do you know what you doin'?

Wizop, whoo
Yeah, ayy

Go

You get the bag and fumble it
I get the bag and flip it and tumble it 
Straight out the lot, three hundred cash 
And the car came with a blunt in it 
Lil' mama a thot, and she got ass 
And she gon' fuck up a bag 
Pull up to the spot, livin' too fast 
Droppin' the dope in the stash 
In Italy, got two foreign hoes, they DM me 
Drop the top when it's cold 
But you feel the heat 
Be real with me
Keep it 100, just be real with me 
Eat it up like it's a feast 
They say the dope on fleek 
Percocet pill on me 
Ice on my neck, baby, chill with me 
Them niggas that post in the back don't say nothin'
Them niggas will kill for me
Back ends I count in my sleep, on fleek
Hundred K spent on a Patek Phillippe 
Bitch, I'm a dog, eat my treat 
Hop out the frog and leap 
I put them bricks in the fender
My bitch, she walk around like she Kris Jenner 
I used to break in and enter
Then Takeoff runnin' like the game of temple 
It's simple, I play with her mental
Mama said she saw me on Jimmy Kimmel 
Count it up, 'cause I'm a money symbol
Walkin' with the racks, I'm lookin' crippled 
Fuck on that bitch then I tip her 
A nickel for me to take pictures 
Not from L.A. but I clip her 
Double my cup, pour a triple 
Fox on my body, no Vivica 
I'm not your average or typical 
Look at my wrist, and it's critical 
Hold it up, droppin' the temperature 
I get that bag on the regular 
I got a bag on my cellular 
Backin' up, baggin' up vegetables 
Bag of them cookies, it's medical 
Cocaine, codeine, etcetera 
Cocaine and lean, it's federal 
I take off, landin' on Nebula
As of now twenty M's on my schedule

Came out of jail and went straight to the top
Take it easy, baby, middle of summer, I'm freezin', baby 
Don't leave me, baby
Just drop to your knees and please me, baby

Guess I was just another pit stop
'Til you made up your mind
You just wasted my time
You were on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly, babe
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me

I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
When the morning comes, when we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind, not the fire that we begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened, I think that we both know the way that this story ends
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind 'cause
This just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile, but
Know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I been, I been thinkin'
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
When the evening falls and I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else, well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now, if we jump together, at least we can swim far away from the wreck we made
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind 'cause
This just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile, but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Worry 'bout who all gives a damn
'Bout where we've been and where we ended up

And all the rest is history
An epiphany that all we need is us

It feel like my life ain't mine 
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today, I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why
All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout, they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down, but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine

You don't gotta die today, you don't gotta die
I want you to be alive, I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die, now let me tell you why
It's the very first breath when your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air when you're there chest-to-chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long, seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection, finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine 
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today, I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive, I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh, I don't wanna
I don't wanna

Want to waste a half a million, be my guest
Made me wanna buy a vest and a TEC

Hate me, never met me in the flesh

Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along?
Saw a model on a billboard, 1-800 get to know me
Wondered was she Photoshopped, or were her eyes really that lonely?
Did she leave her hometown thinkin' she'd end up in L.A.?
Did she break down in the desert and get stuck beside the highway?

We gon' do a drive by in the Wraith
I'ma take it to trial
Pray to Lord I beat the case
That money be callin'
I don't do no talkin'
So get the fuck outta my face
Got a TEC and a chopper
With a hundred thousand dollars up in the 
Wraith
You know I ain't slippin'
You know that I'm with it
I'll shoot him right up in his face
3Three say that I'm trippin'
You know that I'm drippin'
I'm wrapped in Saran today
I just bought a brand new watch from God
I ain't put it on yet
I don't care 'bout no bitch
I ain't givin' her shit
Spend it all on my homies
I can put on my son, from my car to my house
Everything, I own it
When it come to that money you know I ain't stuntin'
I be on it
I just got a pet monkey, cashed out on a tiger
But really don't want it, my son don't like him
He say that we beefin', you know I won't fight him
My clip full of thunder, you know that I'll strike 'em
Wanna join NBA, go and catch you a body
Free Kevin Gates, it's a murder for hire
Double G gang on the front of my title
Got rid of my Glock and I bought me a rifle
Tryna hide from the camera, I ain't goin' outside today

I'ma pull up in style, we gon' do a drive by in the Wraith
I'ma take it to trial, pray to Lord I beat the case
I jump out at your house
I ain't shootin' from the corner
Been bought me a bitch but I really don't want her
I don't do no cappin', I keep it one hunnid
Right now I'm recordin' with ten thousand on me
He say he want smoke but I know he don't want it
Shoot him and his bitch and I up on his homie
You know how I'm feelin'
I don't got to say it
Face every problem all by my lonely
Tryna hide from the camera, I ain't goin' outside today

Are you staring a hole through your phone, praying that it rings?
Are you watching a movie that you've seen a thousand times?
Or maybe playing some Mayer
, getting lost in your favorite lines
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice
I’m one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away
Are you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips?
Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss?
Are you changing the station replacing our favorite songs?
Well maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes on the moving on
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To outrun the storm
But I'm almost out that door
And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face

Will you pick up when I call?
Or just forget we loved at all
We don't have to talk
I just wanna hear your voice
And I'm one number away
From calling you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess

100,"""Believer""",Imagine Dragons,https://genius.com/Imagine-dragons-believer-lyrics,"First things first, I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
Second things second, don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh
I was broken from a young age, taking my sulkin' to the masses
Writing my poems for the few that look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
Singing from heartache from the pain, taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain, seeing the beauty through the
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Third things third, send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh
I was chokin' in the crowd, building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
, 
hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down like
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Last things last, by the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down like
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer"
