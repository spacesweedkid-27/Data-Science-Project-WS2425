1,"""Last Night""",Morgan Wallen,https://genius.com/Morgan-wallen-last-night-lyrics,"Last night, we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night I kissed your lips
Make you grip the sheets with your fingertips
Last bottle of Jack, we split a fifth
Just talkin' 'bout life, goin' sip for sip
Yeah, you, you know you love to fight
And I say shit I don't mean
But I'm still gon' wake up wantin' you and me
I know that last night, we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night 
No way it was our last night 
No way it was the last night that we break up
I see your tail lights in the dust
You call your mama, I call your bluff
In the middle of the night, pull it right back up
Yeah, my, my friends say, ""Let her go""
Your friends say, ""What the hell?""
I wouldn't trade your kind of love for nothin' else
Oh, baby, last night, we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night, we said we'd had enough
I can't remember everything we said, but we said too much
I know you packed your shit and slammed the door right before you left
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night 
No way it was our last night 
I know you said this time you really weren't comin' back again
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night 
No way it was our last night "
2,"""Flowers""",Miley Cyrus,https://genius.com/Miley-cyrus-flowers-lyrics,"We were good, we were gold
Kinda dream that can't be sold
We were right 'til we weren't
Built a home and watched it burn
Mm, I didn't wanna leave you, I didn't wanna lie
Started to cry, but then remembered I
I can buy myself flowers
Write my name in the sand
Talk to myself for hours
Say things you don't understand
I can take myself dancing
And I can hold my own hand
Yeah, I can love me better than you can
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby
Paint my nails cherry-red
Match the roses that you left
No remorse, no regret
I forgive every word you said
Ooh, I didn't wanna leave you, baby, I didn't wanna fight
Started to cry, but then remembered I
I can buy myself flowers
Write my name in the sand
Talk to myself for hours, yeah
Say things you don't understand
I can take myself dancing, yeah
I can hold my own hand
Yeah, I can love me better than you can
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby
Can love me better, I 
I didn't wanna leave you, I didn't wanna fight
Started to cry, but then remembered I
I can buy myself flowers 
Write my name in the sand
Talk to myself for hours 
Say things you don't understand 
I can take myself dancing, yeah
I can hold my own hand
Yeah, I can love me better than
Yeah, I can love me better than you can
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby 
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby 
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby
Can love me better, I"
3,"""Kill Bill""",SZA,https://genius.com/Sza-kill-bill-lyrics,"I'm still a fan even though I was salty
Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy
Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin'
I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one should
I might
I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him though
Rather be in jail than alone
I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
This text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
I tried to ration with you, no murders or crime of passion, but damn
You was out of reach
You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
Now I'm in the basement plannin' home invasion
Now you layin' face-down, got me singin' over a beat
I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one will
I might 
I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him though
Rather be in jail than alone
I did it all for love 
I did it all on no drugs 
I did all of this sober
I did it all for us, oh
I did it all for love 
I did all of this on no drugs 
I did all of this sober
Don't you know I did it all for us? 
Oh, I just killed my ex , not the best idea 
Killed his girlfriend next, how'd I get here? 
I just killed my ex , I still love him though 
Rather be in Hell than alone"
4,"""Anti-Hero""",Taylor Swift,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-anti-hero-lyrics,"I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
, 
all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me 
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us from Hell""
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees
It's me, hi 
I'm the problem, it's me 
At teatime , everybody agrees 
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero"

I just can't say I don't love you 
'Cause I love you, yeah
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh
Even though we're goin' through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind 'cause
Baby, I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah 
I'm findin' ways to manipulate the feelin' you're goin' through
But, baby girl, I'm not blamin' you
Just don't blame me, too, yeah
'Cause I can't take this pain forever
And you won't find no one that's better
'Cause I'm right for you, babe
I think I'm right for you, babe
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect

Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby
I'm just sayin', yeah
I would die for you, I would lie for you
Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby

8,"""Fast Car""",Luke Combs,https://genius.com/Luke-combs-fast-car-lyrics,"You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Startin' from zero, got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothin' to prove
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
Been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across the bord–µr and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to b–µ livin'
See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for workin'
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, ""Somebody's gotta take care of him""
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
We go cruisin', entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinkin' late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me'd find it
I got no plans, I ain't goin' nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision

We revvin' up and goin' on a run like we DMC
I layup with her for a couple days, then it's BRB
You rappers love askin' if I fucked, when you know we did
When you know we did
She came in heels but she left out on her cozy shit
Ayy, I'm livin' every twenty-four like Kobe did
Shoutout to the 6ix, R.I.P. to 8
Swear this shit is gettin' ate, I'm on ten for the cake
Get a lot of love from twelve, but I don't reciprocate
Fifty-one division stay patrollin' when it's late

Someone to pick you up when you're feelin' down, feelin' lonely
Need somebody who can make it better
Somebody who can open up those gates
Open up those gates to your heart
Only if you'll let me
I'm on the stage right now, singin' your favorite song
Look in the crowd, and you're nowhere to be found as they sing along
I say, ""You look good without no make-up, no lashes, even better when you wake up"" 
I see the look on your face, I see you're lookin' for peace
I see you're tired of the hurt, tired of the pain, tired of the nights where you can't get no sleep
I see you're tired thinkin' 'bout if he cheat
See you tired thinkin' 'bout if you're leavin'
See you tired of bein' so tired
And you're damn sure ain't gettin' even
Need somebody who can make it better
Somebody who can open up those gates
Open up those gates to your heart
Only if you'll let me
I'm on the stage right now, singin' your favorite song
Look in the crowd, and you're nowhere to be found as they sing along
I say, ""You look good without no make-up, no lashes, even better when you wake up"" 
Gonna make you change what you probably
Don't like anyway 'bout you darlin'
So you might as well
Be somebody
Who can make you face what you're guardin'
Open up the gates where your heart is
And just be yourself
Hmm"

Cole world, hello niggas
Made it out the city with my head on straight
Niggas keep shootin' up the lead out
Young Jordan Peele, gotta get out
And the shit that I spit out
Is a cheat code like I'm facin' a RICO
And how a nigga put a hit out
And another one, and, and another one
I got like a hundred of 'em
'Bout to lap niggas so they think they ahead of me
But I'm really in front of them
Now some of them fumblin' they bags
Fuckin' up the little crumbs that they had
A reminder to humble yourself
This shit could be gone in an instant
Me, I'm runnin' long distance, all pistons firin'
I been stuck between maybe retirin'
And feelin' like I'm just not hittin' my prime
These days seein' rappers be dyin'
Way before they even gettin' they shine
I never even heard of lil' buddy
'Til somebody murdered lil' buddy
Now I'm on the phone, searchin' lil' buddy name
Got to playin' his tunes
All day in my room, thinkin', ""Damn
This shit wicked, to get they names buzzin'
Some niggas just gotta go lay in a tomb""
And media thirsty for clicks
I got a new rule
If you ain't never posted a rapper when he was alive
You can't post about him after he get hit
It's simple, it's the principle
On any tempo, I'm invincible
Don't even rap, I just vent to you
I rather that than an interview most days
Fuck 'em all like I'm goin' through a ho phase
Young nigga shoot out the whip like road rage
I pray all of my dawgs stay so paid
And the only thing that kill 'em is old age

Is a one-night or a wife
I find it dizzying 
They're bringing up my history 
But you weren't even listening 
I feel
The lavender haze creepin' up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
That lavender haze
Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk 
Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
I feel 
The lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal 
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
That lavender haze
I just wanna stay
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze"

Si, si, dos
Si, si
Beber droga me transform√≥ en un superh√©roe, si, si
Me tom√© esa pastilla, me transform√≥ en un superh√©roe, si, Super
Boominati me transform√≥ en un superh√©roe, si 
Estoy en esa droga otra vez, estoy en ese flow de nuevo
Cambi√© el flow de nuevo, s√≠, s√≠ 
M√°s ca√≠do que un paraca√≠das, agarrando ese poste de nuevo
Estoy en es–µ aceite otra vez, s√≠, s√≠
Dulc–µs en la taza, tengo que pagar 
Rey de las calles, joven negro hecho
Rociando a la multitud, ll√©valo a la tumba
No estoy teniendo problemas, estoy bebiendo el Barre
Un saludo a Dallas, mi perra es una estrella
Negro, hazte rico, mejor ll√©valo a la guerra
Orino en tu ata√∫d, disparo a tu amplia
Haces algo desagradable, ¬øTe enrollar√°n en un porro?
Perra ponte en el gr√°fico, f√≥llame en un auto
Te compro un nuevo Rollie ma√±ana
Puse ese nuevo Rollie en tu brazo
No me muevo lento cuando estoy llendo en aceite
Pulseras de tenis y llegaron con las heladas
Enlaces cubanos hasta la mand√≠bula
Intensifiqu√© el estilo cuando pise una amplia
Dos y medio, ooh, ese es el m√°s barato
He estado apilando estos cientos, como cupones
Te lo dije por ahora nunca m√°s, escal√≥n superior
Me pongo a apilar, soy intocable
Puedo representar, el dinero m√∫ltiple
Cuando estoy en la cima de las listas, es inaccesible
Pan por hogaza, turbo el motor
Tic-Tac-Toe, mato a otro buitre
Vendi√©ndoles tazones, perra, haz yoga
Merezco un premio, sirviendo a estas rocas
Cien mil grandes cuando compro, ese es el total
Lleno el garaje, perra, soy un magnate
No hay fachada, no hay fugazi
Salto, me pagan
Royce estilo top, me estoy volviendo loco
Empujo, fumando en la neblina
No intentes usar hilo dental, tonos Cartier
Dulces en la taza, tengo que pagar 
Rey de las calles, joven negro hecho
Rociando a la multitud, ll√©valo a la tumba
No estoy teniendo problemas, estoy bebiendo el Barre
Un saludo a Dallas, mi perra es una estrella
Negro, hazte rico, mejor ll√©valo a la guerra
Orino en tu ata√∫d, disparo a tu amplia
Haces algo desagradable, ¬øTe enrollar√°n en un porro?

Pulseras de tenis y llegaron con las heladas
Enlaces cubanos hasta la mand√≠bula
Intensifiqu√© el estilo cuando pise una amplia
El Caballero Negro lo siente, muere y s√© un h√©roe
O vive lo suficiente para verte convertido en un villano
Tan pronto como te levantas, estos negros quieren derribarte
El peso del mundo se sienta sobre mis hombros, sost√©n la corona
No tengo una capa, as√≠ que no puedo salvarte ahora
Los negros quieren odiar  prefieren verte ahogarte 
Y el mundo sigue girando
Como si fuera el √∫nico en √©l 
No quieren verte ganar 
Entonces, ¬øqui√©n es realmente el villano? 
¬øQui√©n es el villano? ¬øQui√©n es el villano?
Vive lo suficiente para verte convertido en un villano"

feelin' super childish, no Donald Glover
Missed call from my mother
Like, ""Where you at tonight?""
Got no alibi
I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you
Shine
It's your golden hour
 
You slow down time
In your golden hour 
We were just two lovers
Feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast burnin' through the summer
Radio on blast, make the moment last, 
she got solar power
Minutes feel like hours
She knew she was the baddest
Can you even imagine fallin' like I did
For the love of my life?
She's got glow on her face
A glorious look in her eyes
My angel of light
I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin

Eight words when I think about us is fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me
Disrespect ya and I'll smack 'em

The videos we got ever leak, we goin' viral or goin' platinum
Don't worry 'bout your friend's story when I had her alone
She gon' try and put some extras on it, take you out of your zone
You know how it goes when they can't get a reservation up in Carbone
They gon' tell you it's a chill night, tell you how they'd rather stay home, yeah
Jealous-ass hoes, yeah
And I know what I said 'bout bein' in Vogue

Girl, one call, I'll get you in Vogue
One call, you in runway shows
One call, I'm sittin' front row
One wrong call from your ex nigga sayin' dumb shit'll get him sent home
One call and my niggas ten toes

There's a U-Haul trailer, the next thing you know
Your old apartment, is y'all's new place
There goes the carpet but the deer head stays

Spend it all at a jewelry store

Sunburnt on a honeymoon beach and your

And there the next two or three years go

There's a test on the counter, next thing you know

Nobody's ever called you that

More in love than you've ever been
With a lot of years of remember when's and still some down the road

And you take 'em to church, teach 'em to fish
And you, tell 'em stories every chance you get

I met him at the bar, it was twelve or something
I ordered two more wines 'cause tonight, I want him
A little context if you care to listen
I find myself in a shit position
The man that I love sat me down last night
And he told me that it's over, dumb decision
And I don't wanna feel how my heart is rippin'
In fact, I don't wanna feel, so I stick to sippin'
And I'm out on the town with a simple mission
In my little black dress and this shit is sittin'
Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro

To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways

Last night really was the cherry on the cake
Been some dark days lately and I'm findin' it cripplin'
Excuse my state, I'm as high as your hopes
That you'll make it to my bed, get me hot and sizzlin'
If I take a step back to see the glass half-full
At least it's the Prada two-piece that I'm trippin' in
And I'm already actin' like a dick, know what I mean?

With a toy on Christmas Day

Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow 
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick 
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight 
Holding on to me so tight 
What more can I do?
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere 
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air 
And everyone is singing 
I hear those sleigh bells ringing 
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? 
Won't you please bring my baby to me?
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for 
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh, I just want you for my own

Just like the air, I'm everywhere, how you say it's up with me?
P-poppin' shit, you would think I went to school for chiropractin' 
Lookin' good as hell today, just sent my nigga five attachments 
Why did you confront me 'bout a nigga? Man, you bitches backwards 
They come at me 'bout niggas who I don't even find attractive 
I don't know that nigga, I just seened him on the town before
I can't be up in her face, I took her nigga down before 
When I lose a nigga, I just pop out and go find some mor–µ 
Soon as I feel like my time get wast–µd, then it's time to go 
They say they don't fuck with me, but I say they can't fuck with me 
Just like the air, I'm everywhere, how you say it's up with me 
Them bitches should've stayed down, they could've been up with me 
But all they doin' is talkin' down, 'cause they can't get up with me 
My ex fuckin' on my old friend, both they ass some fuckin' clowns 
Thinkin' that she got one up on me, she got my hand-me-downs 
He thought he wasn't gon' have to stand on shit, like he was handicap 
Make that nigga stand on that, now his ass can't stand me now
High as fuck, I'm lit, yuh, I don't smoke no swishers 
Slidin' with my gang and 'nem, look at them like sisters 
These bitches be lettin' them go out sad about these niggas 
I don't wanna hang with them, they don't handle business 
They be goin' for anything, but I can't go for none of that 
Why would I go chase you if I know you gon' come runnin' back? 
Cut everybody off, lately been feelin' like the lumberjack 
They really had me fucked up, and I wasn't goin' for none of that 
She the type, the nigga make her mad she go tweet somethin' 
Me, I'm kinda ratchet still so I'm the type to beat somethin' 
I can't love you, baby, like your bitch do, so don't leave her 
He gon' choose her every time 'cause it's cheaper to keep her 
Can't say your name up in my songs, might not fuck with you tomorrow 
Can get my feelings hurt today, I won't give a fuck tomorrow 
Ain't fucked up 'bout no credit score, I might be rich as fuck tomorrow 
Every day the sun won't shine, but that's why I love tomorrows
[Verse 2: Cardi B & 
GloRilla

Ridin' with my twin and 'nem , and we all look good as fuck 
She say she my opp but I don't know her, had to look her up 
I know that I'm rich, but I can't help it, bitch, I'm hood as fuck 
I've been on these bitches neck so long, sometimes my foot get stuck 
I can't put you in my business (
No
), you might wish me dead tomorrow (
Yeah
)
Bitches be on dick today, sing every word of ""Up"" tomorrow 
Bitch, I still got cases open, keep your mouth shut tomorrow (
Shh
)
Play with me today then get some sleep, you know it's up tomorrow 
Fake bitch, that's why my friend fucked on your nigga 
Both you bitches pussy, I think y'all should scissor 
She bought a chain, I bought the same one, even bigger 
She throwin' shots, that's how I know I got her triggered 
I don't speak dog ho (
Woof
), I don't care what no bitch say 
I stay on her mind, I got condos in that bitch head 
She say she don't fuck with me , who said that you can, ho? 
That nigga a munch and he gon' eat me like a mango
Long ass weave, it be ticklin' my ass crack 
Wonder what I'll do tomorrow that these hoes will be mad at (
Huh?
)
All y'all bitches sweet, and I always get my lick, boo 
I, I fight for my bitches and I'm fightin' over dick too 
Can't say your name up in my songs, might not fuck with you tomorrow 
Can get my feelings hurt today, I won't give a fuck tomorrow
Ain't fucked up 'bout no credit score, I might be rich as fuck tomorrow 
Every day the sun won't shine, but that's why I love tomorrow
Can't say your name up in my songs, might not fuck with you tomorrow 
Can get my feelings hurt today, I won't give a fuck tomorrow

Labrador hangin' out the passenger door
The sand from your hair is blowin' in my eyes
Blame it on the beach, grown men don't cry
Do you remember that beat-down basement couch?
I'd sing you my love songs and you'd tell me about
How your mama ran off and pawned her ring
I remember, I remember everything

You were b–µggin' me to stay 'til the sun rose

You only smile like that when you're drinkin'

You're drinkin' everything to ease your mind
But when the hell are you gonna ease mine?

I doubt it, forget about it, whatever
It's all the same anyways
I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown
In the name of someone I no longer know
For the shame of bein' young, drunk, and alone
Traffic lights and a transmitter radio
I don't like that when they threw me in the car
I gave your name as my emergency phone call
Honey, it rang and rang
Even the cops thought you were wrong for hangin' up
I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'd die for you
I'm untetherin' from the parts of me you'd recognize
From charmin' to alarmin' in seconds
I'll be bedridden, I'll let the pain metastasize
But that's morning, I'll forget it
And the dial tone is all I have
I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown
In the name of someone I no longer know

I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'd die for you
Well, I'd die for you
I beg you, sir, just let me call
I'll give you my blood alcohol
I'll rot with all the burnouts in the cell
I'll change my faith, I'll praise the flag
Let's wait, I swear she'll call me back
""Son, are you a danger to yourself?""
Fuck that, sir, just let me call
I'll give you my blood alcohol
I'll rot with all the burnouts in the cell
I'll change my faith, 
I'll kiss the badge
Let's wait, I swear she'll call me back
""Son, why do you do this to yourself?""
And I said
 I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown
In the name of someone I no longer know 
For the shame of bein' young, drunk, and alone

I don't like that when they threw me in the car

A face-on lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover, but you tore me apart

Maybe next year
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special

Her heart's like a feather in a Tulsa wind
Seaside breeze'll bring her to life
And all them other boys say she's a goodbye girl
She'll wreck your world
And leave before the mornin' sun
But here she is, free, lyin' next to me
'Cause I ain't tryna tame her love
I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair
Keep her heart hangin' on 'round every turn
She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned
Just lookin' for somebody as wild as her
Wild
Wild
Saw that highway unwind in her deep-brown eyes
She saw a long stretch of dirt road dreamin' in mine
She ain't livin' for a diamond ring
Just livin' like the rock 'n' roll song she sings out loud
We're burnin' it down
Blazin' up a trail of smoke
Wherever we are, wherever we go
Yeah, that's where she calls home
I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair
Keep her heart hangin' on 'round every turn
She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned
Just lookin' for somebody as wild as her
Wild
Wild
Yeah, yeah, man
Yeah
I ain't tryna fix her, I just wanna kiss her
Fuel a little fire in her soul
No, we don't say ""forever,"" but when we're together
Swear that we ain't ever lettin' go, yeah, she knows
I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair
Keep her heart hangin' on 'round every turn
She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned
Just lookin' for somebody as wild as her
Wild
Wild
Yeah"

If you wanna learn to throw a curve right
To catch a clean up lookin' on a third strike
Talk a little smack while he's walkin' back
Yeah, I wrote the book
But there's one that lays by the lamp on the nightstand
One that says don't cuss and don't fight
Or let the bottle turn you into a different man
But damn if I don't do it every Friday night
Those get you into Heaven letters in red
Ain't gettin' read enough to keep me on a straight line
I'm a Jack of all trades but man I gotta say
That's one book I didn't write
I met a good girl she had her life straight
She said she loved that I was good at everythin'
One day she left me in a cloud of dust
'Cause I never was too good at pickin' up

Tee time like golf at a quarter to six
I love to fuck on a regular bitch
Famous hoes lame, but they stay on my dick
Heard your new joint, it's embarrassing, shit
You talk to the cops on some therapist shit
You act like you love this American shit
But, really, the truth is you scared of the 6
Yeah, you scared of the 6
Yeah, you scared of the 6
Your bodyguard put in some work on a fluke
Now you wanna go and inherit that shit
Don't talk to the boy 'bout comparisons, shit
Or come to the boy on some arrogant shit
The weapons we got are some terrorist shit
Like TV producers we, grr, we airing this shit
She askin' for bread for her parents and shit
I told her I don't got no cash and she said she could wait on a rack, on some Arabic shit
I pull out a million and stare at the shit
My dick just got hard 'cause a wire just hit
My schedule is out, come spin us, for real
Man, fuck all that spinnin' the narrative shit
I melt down the chains that I bought from yo' boss
Give a fuck about all of that heritage shit
Since V not around, the members done hung up the Louis, they not even wearing that shit
Don't come to the boy 'bout repairing some shit
Don't come to the boy about sparing some shit
You lucky that Vogue was suing 'cause I would've been with the Wassas in Paris and shit

Gave her the blues, not talkin' 'bout belly

We went a-ridin' them old farm ruts
Hangin' out on the gate of his truck
We threw a blanket 'neath the sunset
Bein' brave as eighteen gets
We gave each other more than our hearts
With the help of a mason jar
Drinkin' watermelon moonshine
Cut the burn with a little lime
Parkin' back in them kudzu vines
I was his and every bit of that boy was min–µ
Too young to know what love was
But we wer–µ learnin' on a sweet buzz
There's never nothin' like the first time
And mine's always gonna taste like
Watermelon moonshine
I don't remember where we got it from
I just remember feelin' all grown up
Takin' pulls like it ain't no thing
Never told him it was my first drink
But I told him that he was the one
You're so sure when you're that young
You think you got it all figured out
And now I laugh when I think about
Drinkin' watermelon moonshine
Cut the burn with a little lime
Parkin' back in them kudzu vines

Too young to know what love was
But we were learnin' on a sweet buzz
There's never nothin' like the first time
And mine's always gonna taste like
Watermelon moonshine
I thought that high would last forever
But that ain't what it does
Maybe we were drunk in love
Or maybe we were just
Drinkin' watermelon moonshine
Cut the burn with a little lime
Parkin' back in them kudzu vines
I was his and every bit of that boy was mine
Too young to know what love was
But we were learnin' on a sweet buzz
There's never nothin' like the first time

Watermelon moonshine
