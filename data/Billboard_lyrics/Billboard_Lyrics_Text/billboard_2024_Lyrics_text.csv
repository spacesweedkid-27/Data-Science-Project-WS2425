1,"""Lose Control""",Teddy Swims,https://genius.com/Teddy-swims-lose-control-lyrics,"Something's got a hold of me lately
No, I don’t know myself anymore
Feels like the walls are all closin' in
And the devil's knockin’ at my door, woah
Out of my mind, how many times did I tell you
I'm no good at bein' alone?
Yeah, it's taken a toll on me, tryin' my best to keep
From tearin' the skin off my bones, don't you know
I lose control
When you're not next to me
I’m fallin’ apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you’re not next to me, mhm
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me
Problematic
The problem is I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit
Bad habits hard to break when I'm with you
Yeah, I know I can do it on my own
But I want that real full-moon black magic and it takes two
Problematic
The problem is when I’m with you I'm an addict
And I need some relief, my skin in your teeth
Can't see the forest through the trees
Got me down on my knees, darlin', please, oh
I lose control
When you're not next to me
I'm fallin' apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not next to me 
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me, yeah
I lose control
When you're not here with me, mm
I'm fallin' apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not here with me, mhm
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me"
2,"""A Bar Song (Tipsy)""",Shaboozey,https://genius.com/Shaboozey-a-bar-song-tipsy-lyrics,"My baby want a Birkin, she's been tellin' me all night long
Gasoline and groceries, the list goes on and on
This nine-to-five ain't workin', why the hell do I work so hard?
I can't worry 'bout my problems, I can't take 'em when I'm gone, uh
One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Tell 'em ""Bring another round,"" we need plenty more
Two-steppin' on the table, she don't need a dance floor
Oh my, good Lord
Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey
They know me and Jack Daniеl's got a history
There's a party downtown near 5th Street
Evеrybody at the bar gettin' tipsy
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy
I've been Boozey since I left
I ain't changin' for a check
Tell my ma I ain't forget , I
Woke up drunk at 10 a.m.​
We gon' do this shit again
Tell your girl to bring a friend, oh, Lord
One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Tell 'em ""Bring another round,"" we need plenty more
Two-steppin' on the table, she don't need a dance floor
Oh my, good Lord
Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey 
They know me and Jack Daniel's got a history 
There's a party downtown near 5th Street
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy 
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy
One, here comes the two to the three to the four
When it's last call and they kick us out the door
It's gettin' kind of late, but the ladies want some more
Oh my, good Lord 
Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey 
They know me and Jack Daniel's got a history 
There's a party downtown near 5th Street 
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy 
Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey 
They know me and Jack Daniel's got a history 
At the bottom of a bottle, don't miss me 
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy 
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy
That's fuckin' messed up, bro, they kicked me out the bar"
3,"""Beautiful Things""",Benson Boone,https://genius.com/Benson-boone-beautiful-things-lyrics,"For a while there, it was rough
But lately, I've been doin' better
Than the last four cold Decembers I recall
And I see my family every month
I found a girl my parents love
She'll come and stay the night, and I think I might have it all
And I thank God every day
For the girl He sent my way
But I know the things He gives me, He can take away
And I hold you every night
And that's a feeling I wanna get used to
But there's no man as terrified as the man who stands to lose you
Oh, I hope I don't losе you
Mm, please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
Don't take
Thеse beautiful things that I've got
Please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
Don't take
These beautiful things that I've got
Oh, ooh
Please don't take
I found my mind, I'm feelin' sane
It's been a while, but I'm finding my faith
If everything's good and it's great, why do I sit and wait 'til it's gone?
Oh, I'll tell ya, I know I've got enough
I've got peace and I've got love
But I'm up at night thinkin' I just might lose it all
Please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
Don't take
These beautiful things that I've got
Oh, ooh
Please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
I need
These beautiful things that I've got"

I only hit the curb 'cause you made me
You're tellin' all your friends that I'm crazy
Like I'm the only one
Why'd you throw them stones if you
Had a wild hair of your own or two?
Livin' in your big glass house with a view
I thought you knew
I had some help
It ain't like I can make this kinda mess all by myself
Don't act like you ain't help me pull that bottle off the shelf
Been deep in every weekend if you couldn't tell
They say, ""Teamwork makes the dream work,"" hell, I had some help 
You thought I'd take the blame for us a-crumbling
Go 'round like you ain't guilty of somethin'
Already lost the game that you been runnin'
Guess it's catchin' up to you, huh
You think that you're so innocent
After all the shit you did
I ain't an angel, you ain't heaven-sent
Can't wash our hands of this
I had some help
It ain't like I can make this kinda mess all by myself
Don't act like you ain't help me pull that bottle off the shelf

(
Mustard on the beat, ho
)
Ayy, Mustard on the beat, ho
Deebo any rap nigga, he a free throw
Man down, call an amberlamps, tell him, ""Breathe, bro""
Nail a nigga to the cross, he walk around like Teezo
What's up with these jabroni-ass niggas tryna see Compton?
The industry can hate me, fuck 'em all and they mama
How many opps you really got? I mean, it's too many options
I'm finna pass on this body, I'm John Stockton
Beat your ass and hide the Bible if God watchin'
Sometimes you gotta pop out and show niggas
Certified boogeyman, I'm the one that up the score with 'em
Walk him down, whole time, I know he got some ho in him
Pole on him, extort shit, bully Death Row on him
Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young
You better not ever go to cell block one
To any bitch that talk to him and they in love
Just make sure you hide your lil' sister from him
They tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs
And Party at the party playin' with his nose now
And Baka got a weird case, why is he around?
Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, Dot, fuck 'em up
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, I'ma do my stuff
Why you trollin' like a bitch? Ain't you tired?
Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
You think the Bay gon' let you disrespect Pac, nigga?
I think that Oakland show gon' be your last stop, nigga
Did Cole foul, I don't know why you still pretendin'
What is the owl? Bird niggas and burnt bitches, go
The audience not dumb
Shape the stories how you want, hey, Drake, they're not slow
Rabbit hole is still deep, I can go further, I promise
Ain't that somethin'? B-Rad stands for bitch and you Malibu most wanted
Ain't no law, boy, you ball boy, fetch Gatorade or somethin'
Since 2009, I had this bitch jumpin'
You niggas'll get a wedgie, be flipped over your boxers
What OVO for? The ""Other Vaginal Option""? Pussy
Nigga better straighten they posture, got famous all up in Compton
Might write this for the doctorate,
 
tell the pop star quit hidin'
Fuck a caption, want action, no accident
And I'm hands-on, he fuck around, get polished
Fucked on Wayne girl while he was in jail, that's connivin'
Then get his face tatted like a bitch apologizin'
I'm glad DeRoz' came home, y'all didn't deserve him neither
From Alondra down to Central, nigga better not speak on Serena
And your homeboy need subpoena, that predator move in flocks
That name gotta be registered and placed on neighborhood watch
I lean on you niggas like another line of Wock'
Yeah, it's all eyes on me, and I'ma send it up to Pac, ayy
Put the wrong label on me, I'ma get 'em dropped, ayy
Sweet Chin Music and I won't pass the aux, ayy
How many stocks do I really have in stock? Ayy
One, two, three, four, five, plus five, ayy
Devil is a lie,
 
he a 69 God, ayy
Freaky-ass niggas need to stay they ass inside, ayy
Roll they ass up like a fresh pack of 'za, ayy
City is back up, it's a must, we outside, ayy
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
Once upon a time, all of us was in chains
Homie still doubled down callin' us some slaves
Atlanta was the Mecca, buildin' railroads and trains
Bear with me for a second, let me put y'all on game
The settlers was usin' townfolk to make 'em richer
Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda
You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance
Let me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge
You called Future when you didn't see the club 
Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up 
21 gave you false street cred
Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head 
Quavo said you can be from Northside 
2 Chainz say you good, but he lied
You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars
No, you not a colleague, you a fuckin' colonizer
The family matter and the truth of the matter
It was God's plan to show y'all the liar
Mm
Mm-mm
He a fan, he a fan, he a fan 
He a fan, he a fan, he a
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Let me hear you say, ""OV-ho"" (
OV-ho
)
Say, ""OV-ho"" (
OV-ho

Then step this way, step that way
Then step this way, step that way
Are you my friend?
Are we locked in?
Then step this way, step that way
Then step this way, step that way"

My honeybee, come and get this pollen
 Too bad your ex don't do it for ya
 Walked in and dream-came-trued it for ya
 Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya 
 I know I Mountain Dew it for ya
 That morning coffee, brewed it for ya

Beach towel rests on the dryin' line
Do I remind you of your daddy in his '88 Ford?
Labrador hangin' out the passenger door
The sand from your hair is blowin' in my eyes
Blame it on the beach, grown men don't cry
Do you remember that beat-down basement couch?
I'd sing you my love songs and you'd tell me about
How your mama ran off and pawned her ring
I remember, I remember everything
A cold shoulder at closing time
You were bеggin' me to stay 'til the sun rose
Strangе words come on out
Of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke
Pictures and passin' time
You only smile like that when you're drinkin'
I wish I didn't, but I do
Remember every moment on the nights with you
You're drinkin' everything to ease your mind
But when the hell are you gonna ease mine?
You're like concrete feet in the summer heat
It burns like hell when two souls meet
No, you'll never be the man that you always swore
But I'll remember you singin' in that '88 Ford

It's 10 o'clock before I say a word
Baby, I can never tell
How do you sleep so well?
You keep tellin' me to live right
To go to bed before the daylight
But then you wake up for the sunrise
You know you don't gotta pretend
Baby, now and then
Don't you just wanna wake up, dark as a lake
Smellin' like a bonfire, lost in a haze?
If you're drunk on life, babe, I think it's great
But while in this world
I think I'll take my whiskey neat
My coffee black
 
and my bed at 3
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whiskеy neat
My coffee black and my bed at 3
You're too sweet for mе
You're too sweet for me
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
I aim low
I aim true, 
and the ground's where I go
I work late where I'm free from the phone
And the job gets done
But you worry some, I know
But who wants to live forever, babe?
You treat your mouth as if it's Heaven's gate
The rest of you like you're the TSA
I wish I could go along
Babe, don't get me wrong
You know you're 
bright as the morning, as soft as the rain
Pretty as a vine, as sweet as a grape
If you can sit in a barrel, maybe I'll wait
Until that day
I'd rather take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at 3
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at 3
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
I take my whiskey neat

You must've had yourself a change of heart like halfway through the drive
Because your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign
Kept on drivin' straight and left our future to the right
Now I am stuck between my anger and the blame that I can't face
And memories are somethin' even
 
smoking weed does not replace
And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains
Doc told me to travel, but there's Covid on the planes
And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do
So I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad
That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from Dad
No, I am no longer funny 'cause I miss the way you laugh
You once called me ""forever,"" now you still can't call me back
And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do
Oh, that'll have to do
My other half was you
I hope this pain's just passin' through
But I doubt it
And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do
Have to do"

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night

Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it

Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it

We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it

So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar 
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate 
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
He looks up, grinnin' like a devil
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar 
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate 
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""

'Til I'm in the grave
'Til I rot away, dead and buried
'Til I'm in the casket you carry
If you go, I'm goin' too, uh
'Cause it was always you 
And if I'm turnin' blue, please don't save me
Nothin' left to lose without my baby
Birds of a feather, we should stick together
, I know
I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone
Can't change the weather, might not be forever
But if it's forever, it's even better
And I don't know what I'm cryin' for
I don't think I could love you more
It might not be long, but baby, I
I'll love you 'til the day that I die
'Til the day that I die
'Til the light leaves my eyes
'Til the day that I die
I want you to see, hm
How you look to me, hm
You wouldn't believe if I told ya
You would keep the compliments I throw ya
But you're so full of shit, uh
Tell me it's a bit, oh
Say you don't see it, your mind's polluted
Say you wanna quit, don't be stupid
And I don't know what I'm cryin' for
I don't think I could love you more
It might not be long, but baby, I
Don't wanna say goodbye
Birds of a feather, we should stick together,
 I know 
I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone

And no one here's to blame
But what about your quiet treason?

Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for workin'
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, ""Somebody's gotta take care of him""
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
We go cruisin', entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinkin' late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me'd find it
I got no plans, I ain't goin' nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way"

Make me lose my breath, make me water
Make me sweat, make me hotter

I'ma be  in a dangerous mood
Can you match my timing? 
Tellin' me  that you really 'bout it
Why try hide it? Ooh
Talk is cheap
, so show me
That you understand how I like it
Can you blow my mind?
Set off my whole body
If I give you my time 
Can you snatch my soul from me?
I don't wanna wait, come take it
Take me where I ain't been before
Can you blow my mind?
Set off my whole body, whole body

Hopefully you can last all night
Don't get too excited 
Oh, privacy , you ain't gotta go nowhere
You can stay inside it

25,"""Feather""",Sabrina Carpenter,https://genius.com/Sabrina-carpenter-feather-lyrics,"Oh, not another take
Oh, it's like that, I'm your dream come true
When it's on a platter for you
Then you pull back when I try to make plans
More than two hours in advance, mm
I slam the door, I hit ignore
I'm saying, ""No, no, no, no more""
I got you blocked, after this, an afterthought
I finally cut you off
I feel so much lighter like a feather with you off my mind 
Floatin' through the memories like whatever, you're a waste of time 
Your signals are mixed, you act like a bitch
You fit every stereotype, ""Send a pic""
I feel so much lighter like a feather with you out my life
With you out my life
Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather, yeah
It feels so good
Not carin' where you are tonight
And it feels so good
Not pretendin' to like the wine you like
I slam the door , I hit ignore 
I'm saying, ""No, no, no, no more""
I got you blocked, excited to never talk, I
I'm so sorry for your loss
I feel so much lighter like a feather with you off my mind 
Floatin' through the memories like whatever, you're a waste of time 
Your signals are mixed, you act like a bitch 
You fit every stereotype, ""Send a pic""
I feel so much lighter like a feather with you out my life
With you out my life
Ah, mm
Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather

How could you ever even try?
I don't wanna tiptoe, but I don't wanna hide
But I don't wanna feed this monstrous fire
Just wanna let this story die
And I'll be alright
We can't be friends
But I'd like to just pretend
You cling to your papers and pens
Wait until you like me again
Wait for your love
Lo-love, I'll wait for your love
Me and my truth, we sit in silence
Mm
Baby girl, it's just me and you
'Cause I don't wanna argue, 
but I don't wanna bite
My tongue, yeah, I think I'd rather die
You got me misunderstood
But at least I look this good
We can't be friends
But I'd like to just pretend
You cling to your papers and pens
Wait until you like me again
Wait for your love
Lo-love, I'll wait for your love
I'll wait for your love
Lo-love, I'll wait for your love
Know that you made me
I don't like how you paint me, yet I'm still here hanging
Not what you made me
It's somethin' like a daydream
But I feel so seen in the night
So for now, it's only me
And maybe that's all I need
We can't be friends
But I'd like to just pretend
You cling to your papers and pens
Wait until you like me again
Wait for your love
Lo-love, I'll wait for your love
I'll wait for your love
Lo-love, I'll wait for your love
I'll wait for your love
I'll wait for your love
I'll wait for your love
I'll wait for your love
I'll wait for your love"
27,"""Austin""",Dasha,https://genius.com/Brotxer-and-astin-and-dashxx-head-rides-lyrics,"Моя крыша едет
Идиот
Всё незаконное — для нас запретный плод
И твой легавый ничего тут не найдёт
Уже дымит этот убийственный вещдок
Сегодня, брр, я мизантроп
Глухая тишина — для меня антидот
И если кто-нибудь из ваших не поймёт
Котыгамды жемендер — дайте им перевод
Моя крыша отъехала
Ничего не осталось тут, кроме пепла
Говорил с людьми, но тут их не было
Точно моя крыша поехала
Моя крыша едет
Одинок
Я на соло, будто одинокий волк
Меня заберёт
Ведь я нашел дикий ход на дикий сорт
Готовый на полёт
Мне для этого не нужен самолёт
Готовый на полёт
Мне для этого не нужен самолёт
Моя крыша отъехала
Ничего не осталось тут, кроме пепла
Говорил с людьми, но тут не было
Точно моя крыша поехала
Моя крыша едет"
28,"""Last Night""",Morgan Wallen,https://genius.com/Morgan-wallen-last-night-lyrics,"Last night, we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night I kissed your lips
Make you grip the sheets with your fingertips
Last bottle of Jack, we split a fifth
Just talkin' 'bout life, goin' sip for sip
Yeah, you, you know you love to fight
And I say shit I don't mean
But I'm still gon' wake up wantin' you and me
I know that last night, we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night 
No way it was our last night 
No way it was the last night that we break up
I see your tail lights in the dust
You call your mama, I call your bluff
In the middle of the night, pull it right back up
Yeah, my, my friends say, ""Let her go""
Your friends say, ""What the hell?""
I wouldn't trade your kind of love for nothin' else
Oh, baby, last night, we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night, we said we'd had enough
I can't remember everything we said, but we said too much
I know you packed your shit and slammed the door right before you left
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night 
No way it was our last night 
I know you said this time you really weren't comin' back again
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night 
No way it was our last night "

She'll have you fallin' for it all and then leave right after
And she got a cold heart but she got a warm smile
Cut from the same cloth, she kinda buck wild
Little bit angel, whole lotta outlaw
She's trouble but I'll tell you right now, y'all
Long live cowgirls
Never gonna settle on down girls
Leave you in a lonely ghost town world
Where the sun don't rise, 
rodeo for one night
Love you like a mustang
One hand on thеm giddy-up reins
Hole in your heart with somе good aim
On a goodbye ride but it's fine 'cause it's kinda my thing
Long live cowgirls
Yeah, long live cowgirls
I hate that I love the way them kisses taste like whiskey
How they wake up, take on off, and not even miss me
Leave this heart broken, holdin' that smokin' gun
I guess that's just the way them wild horses run
Let 'em run
Long live cowgirls
Never gonna settle on down girls
Leave you in a lonely ghost town world
Where the sun don't rise, 
rodeo for one night
Love you like a mustang
One hand on them giddy-up reins
Hole in your heart with some good aim
On a goodbye ride but it's fine 'cause it's kinda my thing
Long live cowgirls
Yeah, long live cowgirls
Come on, cowgirls
Don't you wanna take me away?
Lay me on down, girl
With the wild kind of lovin' you make
For God's sake
[Chorus: Morgan Wallen, 
Morgan Wallen & ERNEST

Long live cowgirls
Never gonna settle on down girls
Leave you in a lonely ghost town world
Where the sun don't rise,

30,"""Pink Skies""",Zach Bryan,https://genius.com/Zach-bryan-pink-skies-lyrics,"The kids are in town for a funeral
So pack the car and dry your eyes
I know they got plenty of young blood left in 'em
And plenty nights under pink skies you taught 'em to enjoy
So clean the house, clear the drawers, mop the floors, stand tall
Like no one's ever been here before or at all
And don't you mention all the inches that are scraped on the doorframe
We all know you tiptoed up to 4'1"" back in '08
If you could see 'em now, you'd be proud
But you'd think they's yuppiеs
Your funeral was beautiful
I bet God hеard you comin'
The kids are in town for a funeral
And the grass all smells the same as the day you broke your arm swingin'
On that kid out on the river
You bailed him out, never said a thing about Jesus or the way he's livin'
If you could see 'em now, you'd be proud
But you'd think they's yuppies
Your funeral was beautiful
I bet God heard you comin'
If you could see 'em now, you'd be proud
But you'd think they's yuppies
Your funeral was beautiful
I bet God heard you comin'
The kids are in town for a funeral
So pack the car and dry your eyes
I know they got plenty of young blood left in 'em
And plenty nights under pink skies you taught 'em to enjoy"

Don't know nothin' 'bout that boy you're into
Don't feel bad for you but I feel bad for him
And all the hell you gon' be puttin' him through
Probably tell him we're a burnt out flame
Probably tell him that I ain't been on your mind
How I ain't nothin' but a long gone thing
You can cuss my name, but baby, don't you lie
When you're tasting what he's drinking, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
When you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missin' my street?
Every time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Comin' over tonight, wish that truck in your drive was mine
Just like you know it's supposed to be
When you're up in his bed, am I up in your head?
Makin' you crazy, tell me, baby, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Are you thinkin' 'bout, are you thinkin' 'bout
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Do you hide your phone? Did you change my name?
When he wants to go to our go-to place
Do you tell him you can't? Then go out of your way
To be somewhere, any damn where I ain't
[
Chorus]
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
When you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missin' my street?

When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?

Makin' you crazy, tell me, baby, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Are you thinkin' 'bout, are you thinkin' 'bout
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Don't know where you at
But girl, I know where you oughta be
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
When you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missing my street?
Every time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?

34,"""Miles on It""",Marshmello and Kane Brown,https://genius.com/Marshmello-and-kane-brown-miles-on-it-lyrics,"New truck, big lift
Old roads, we've been
Tearin' up since way back when
But these wheels are innocent
New hitch, new seats, no history
And you just can't fake that
So, let's change that
Girl, let's go put some miles on it
Back of the Chevy with the engine runnin'
Just you and me in a truck bed wide like a California King
We could break it in if you know what I mean
Put some miles on it
Back of the Chevy with the engine runnin'
Just you and me in a truck bed wide like a California King
Wе could break it in if you know what I mean
Put some milеs on it
We could break it in if you know what I mean
All night, no brakes
All tail, no gate
Ain't gotta try too hard
My baby's push to start
All torque, full speed
Off-road, on me
Zero to a hundred fast
My foot ain't touch the gas
I said, ""Hey, baby, slow it down, let's make it last""
You said, ""Where's the fun in that?""
Yeah, let's go, put some miles on it
Back of the Chevy with the engine runnin'
Just you and me in a truck bed wide like a California King
We could break it in if you know what I mean
Put some miles on it
We could break it in if you know what I mean
Put some miles on it
We could break it in if you know what I mean
Mile after mile after mile after mile
Turn up the night like that radio dial
Shoulder to shoulder where nobody knows
Know where we're goin', we ain't goin' home
We're puttin' miles on it
Back of the Chevy with the engine runnin'
Just you and me in a truck bed wide like a California King
We could break it in if you know what I mean
Put some miles on it
Back of the Chevy with the engine runnin'
Just you and me in a truck bed wide like a California King
We could break it in if you know what I mean
Put some miles on it
We could break it in if you know what I mean
Put some miles on it
We could break it in if you know what I mean
Put some miles on it"
35,"""I Can Do It with a Broken Heart""",Taylor Swift,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-i-can-do-it-with-a-broken-heart-lyrics,"I can read your mind
""She's having the time of her life""
There in her glittering prime
The lights refract sequin stars off her silhouette every night
I can show you lies
(
One, two, three, four
)
'Cause I'm a real tough kid
I can handle my shit
They said, ""Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it"" and I did
Lights, camera, bitch, smile
Even when you wanna die
He said he'd love me all his life
But that life was too short
Breaking down, I hit the floor
All the piеces of me shatterеd as the crowd was chanting
, 
""More""
I was grinnin' like I'm winnin'
I was hittin' my marks
'Cause I can do it with a broken heart
(
One, two, three, four
)
I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me like the plague
I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
I can hold my breath
I've been doin' it since he left
I keep finding his things in drawers
Crucial evidence I didn't imagine the whole thing
I'm sure I can pass this test
(
One, two, three, four
)
'Cause I'm a real tough kid
I can handle my shit
They said, ""Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it"" and I did
Lights, camera, bitch, smile
In stilettos for miles
He said he'd love me for all time
But that time was quite short
Breaking down, I hit the floor
All the pieces of me shattered as the crowd was chanting, ""More""
I was grinnin' like I'm winnin'
I was hittin' my marks
'Cause I can do it with a broken heart
(
One, two, three, four
)
I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me , like the plague
I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
You know you're good
And I'm good
'Cause I'm miserable 
And nobody even knows
Ah, try and come for my job"

[
Chorus: Jessie Murph]
Got me wide, wide open
Got a .45 on him
And he pushin' 'bout a 102
Always smokin' somethin'
He ain't worried 'bout nothin'
'Cause he ain't got nothing to lose
I got a thing for the hard liquor on ice
Short days and long nights
Marlboros out the window
Middle finger to the sky
Say you wanna get dangerous
Now you're speakin' my language
I forgot what your name is
So, I'ma call you mine 
I'ma call you mine 
Got me wide, wide open
Got a .45 on him
And he pushin' 'bout a 102
Always smokin' somethin'
He ain't worried 'bout nothin'
'Cause he ain't got nothing to lose
I got a thing for the wild ones 
I got a thing for the wild ones, it's like he knew
I got a thing for the wild ones 
I got a thing for the wild ones, they like me too
 
I'm attracted to things that are really crazy
Asking me how I've been feelin' lately
Coming for mine, then it's do or die
I won't let it slide, no stealin' bases
No back-and-forth bargainin' 
No bitchin' and arguin'
A whole lotta problems, livin' in Gotham
And Bunnie's my Harley Quinn 
Was raised in the darkness, forgive me, I'm guarded 
I have no shame, I'm in love with the heartless
The police will never take us alive
And cowgirls don't cry
Got me wide, wide open
Got a .45 on him
And he pushin' 'bout a 102
Always smokin' somethin'
He ain't worried 'bout nothin'
'Cause he ain't got nothing to lose

Jessie Murph

I got a thing for the wild ones (
Wild, wild, wild

I got a thing for the wild ones, it's like he knew
I got a thing for the wild ones (
Wild, wild, wild

I got a thing for the wild ones, 
they like me too

Yeah (

A thing for the wild ones (
It's like he knew

37,"""Ain't No Love in Oklahoma""",Luke Combs,https://genius.com/Luke-combs-aint-no-love-in-oklahoma-lyrics,"I keep chasing that same old devil
Down the same old dead-end highway
Riding that storm running through my veins
Like a shot down tailspun airplane
Scared of nothing and I'm scared to death
I can't breathe and I catch my breath
But I keep chasing that same old devil
Down the same old dead-end highway
Ain't no love in Oklahoma
Just the whistle of a long black train
You'll know when it's coming for ya
Riding in on the wind and rain
I got saved in the same Red River
The same Red River tryna drown me
It ain't knocking me down, I'm standing my ground
With the whole world falling all around me
I keep running, but I'm standing still
Pray for peace, but I need thе thrill
So I keep chasing that same old devil
Down the samе old dead-end highway
Ain't no love in Oklahoma
Just the whistle of a long black train
You'll know when it's coming for ya
Riding in on the wind and rain
Ain't no love in Oklahoma
Just the whistle of a long black train
You'll know when it's coming for ya
Riding in on the wind and rain
Ain't no love in Oklahoma
Just the whistle of a long black train
You'll know when it's coming for ya
Riding in on the wind and rain"

Pull up in the trenches like Columbine
Pull up with the rocket like NumbaNine

My dog put a nigga in park
Gotta watch out for the narcs

She want a private section, roll off them X's when I'm on Melrose
She tatted my name on her titties, yeah, you can bust it, but it's a borrow
Hol' up, sittin' back, countin' up dubs, I was raised in the borough
She wanna taste it, checkin' the swag today, ho, come back tomorrow
If you know what I know, hide your ho
Just off the facts that we havin' them hunchos
Runnin' around in the lobby, I know that they tired of me havin' like ten hoes

I'm 'bout to nut on her body and tell the ho leave, 'kay
Fifty mil' stuffed in the bag, tell the whole gang eat, uh

Uh, I was listening to the album
Good fucking luck, you're on your own
Guess who's back, back again?
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back
Well, look what the stork brung
 Little baby devil with the forked tongue
And it's stickin' out, yeah, like a sore thumb
 With a forehead that it grew horns from
Still a white jerk
Pullin' up in a Chrysler to the cypher with the vic's, percs and a Bud Light shirt
Lyrical technician, an electrician y'all light work
And I don't gotta play pretend, it's you I make believe
And you know I'm here to stay 'cause me
If I was to ever take a leave, It would be aspirin to break a feve
If I was to ask for Megan Thee Stallion if she would collab with me
Would I really have a shot at a feat? 
I don't know, but I'm glad to be back, like
Abra-abracadabra
 I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh
Abra-abracadabra
 Just like that and I'm back, bruh
Now back in the days of old me
 Right around the time I became a dope fiend
Ate some codeine, as a way of coping
 
taste of opiates, case of O.E
​
Turned me into smiley face emoji
My shit may not be age appropri—
Ate but I will hit an eight year old in the face with a participation trophy
'Cause I have zero doubts
That this whole world's 'bout to turn into some girl scouts
That censorship bureau's out
To shut me down
 
so when I started this verse
It did start off light-hearted at first
But it feels like I'm targeted
Mind bogglin' how my profit has skyrocketed, look what I pocketed
Yeah, the shit is just like y'all have been light joggin' and
 
I've been running at full speed
And that's why I'm ahead like my noggin, and
 
I'm the fight y'all get in
When you debate who the best but ops I'm white-chalkin' when
I step up to that mic, cock it then
""Oh my god, it's him... not again!""
Abra-abracadabra
 I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh
Abra-abracadabra
 Just like that and I'm back, bruh
Sometimes I wonder what the old me'd say
 If he could see the way shit is today
 He'd probably say that everything is gay
 What's my name, what's my name?
So, how many little kids still wanna act like me?
I'm a bigger prick than cacti be
And that's why these words sting, just like you were being attacked by bees
In the coupe leaning back my seat
Bumpin' R. Kelly's favorite group, the black guy pee's
In my Air Max 90's
White T's walkin' parental advisory
My transgender cat's Siamese
Identifies as black, but acts Chinese
Like a motherfuckin' hacky sack I treat the whole world, 'cause I got it at my feet
How can I explain to you?
That even myself, I'm a danger too
I hop on tracks like a kangaroo
And say a few things or two to anger you
But fuck that, if I think that shit, I'ma say that shit
Cancel me what
? Okay, that's it, 
go ahead, Paul, quit
Snake-ass prick,
 
you male crossdresser, fake-ass bitch
And I'll probably get shit for that
 
But you can all suck my dick, in fact
Fuck them, fuck Dre, fuck Jimmy, fuck me, fuck you
, 
fuck my own kids they're brats 
They can screw-off, them and you all
You too, Paul, got two balls, big as RuPaul's,
 
what you thought you saw ain't what you saw
'Cause you're never gon' see me
Caught sleepin' and see the kidnappin' never did happen
Like Sherri Papini, Harry Houdini, I vanish into the thin air as I'm leaving, like
Abra-abracadabra
 I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh
Abra-abracadabra
 Just like that and I'm back, bruh"

To invite you to the party
Then you walked in with those green eyes
Never stolen by nobody
And they flicker to the future
For a moment, I could picture
Then you touch me and I come back
And we're talking on the staircase
'Bout your big dreams on the big screens
Out of Georgia, now you're lonely in this city
Lyin' with me
And you're scared it's movin' quickly
Oh, now you're crying, you're in pieces
'Cause the only love you've ever known is Jesus
I can feel it
Oh, I hate that I'm the reason that you're
In your head right now
While your world is spinning out
So slow it down
Take a moment now
We're too young to drown
Deep in dirty waters
Full of hopeless doubt
Let me pull you out
Let me hold you now
Let me slow it down
Ain't it funny how it changes?
How the future rearranges
I get nervous, oh, I'm anxious
Maybe loving you is dangerous
I could lose you like the others
Only girl that's never left me is my mother
Oh, I love her
And I know you'll probably hate it, but I'm
In my head right now
So slow it down
Take a moment now
We're too young to drown
Deep in dirty waters
Full of hopeless doubt
Let me pull you out
Let me hold you now
Let me 
Slow it down
When you're on the ground
And you're crying
I'm trying
 
To slow it down
When you're spinning 'round
In your head
I'll help you slow it down"

Won't you please bring my baby to me?

Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
I loved you truly
You gotta laugh at the stupidity
'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, fame fucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire
And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called 'em crazy too
You're so convincing
How do you lie without flinching? 
Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will
Went for me and not her

You can't love anyone 'cause that would mean you had a heart

Somebody save me, me from myself
I've spent so long livin' in hell
They say my lifestyle is bad for my health
It's the only thing that seems to help
All of this drinkin' and smokin' is hopeless but feel like it's all that I need
Somethin' inside of me's broken, I hold on to anything that sets me free
I'm a lost cause
Baby, don't waste your time on me
I'm so damaged beyond repair
Life has shattered my hopes and my dreams
I'm a lost cause
Baby, don't waste your time on me
I'm so damaged beyond repair
Life has shattered my hopes and my dreams
What if the night sky was missin' the moon?
There were no shootin' stars to use wishin' on you
And all of my sorrows, I'd just wash them down
It's the only peace I've ever found
All of this drinkin' and smokin' is hopeless but feel like it's all that I need
Somethin' inside of me's broken, I hold on to anything that sets me free
I'm a lost cause
Baby, don't waste your time on me
I'm so damaged beyond repair
Life has shattered my hopes and my dreams
I'm a lost cause
Baby, don't waste your time on me
I'm so damaged beyond repair
Life has shattered my hopes and my dreams"

Euphoria
Them super powers gettin' neutralized, I can only watch in silence
The famous actor we once knew is lookin' paranoid and now is spiralin'
You're movin' just like a degenerate, every antic is feelin' distasteful
I calculate you're not as calculated, I can even predict your angle
Fabricatin' stories on the family front 'cause you heard 
Mr. Morale
A pathetic master manipulator, I can smell the tales on you now
You'rе not a rap artist, you a scam artist with the hopes of being accеpted
Tommy Hilfiger stood out, but FUBU never had been your collection
I make music that electrify 'em, you make music that pacify 'em
I can double down on that line, but spare you this time, that's random acts of kindness
Know you a master manipulator and habitual liar too
But don't tell no lie about me and I won't tell truths 'bout you
Shoo, shoo, shoo
Shoo, shoo, shoo
Bee, bee, bee, bee, bee, bee
Yeah, I'm out the way, yeah, I'm low, okay
Yeah, the island right here's remote, okay
I ain't thinkin' about no reaper, nigga, I'm reapin' what I sow, okay
Got a Benjamin and a Jackson all in my house like I'm Joe, okay
Hellcat, made his homeboys and them type sell they soul, okay
Everybody wanna be demon 'til they get chipped by a throwaway
And I might do a show a day, once a lame, always a lame
Oh, you thought the money, the power or fame would make you go away?
Have you ever played have-you-ever? Okay, nigga, let's play
Have you ever walked your enemy down like with a poker face?
Have you ever paid five hundred thou' like to an open case?
Well, I have, and I failed at both, but I came out straight
I hate when a rapper talk about guns, then somebody die, they turn into nuns
Then hop online like ""Pray for my city,"" he fakin' for likes and digital hugs
His daddy a killer, he wanna be junior, they must've forgot the shit that they done
Dementia must run in his family, but let it get shaky
I'll park his son
The very first time I shot me a Drac', the homie had told me to aim it this way
I didn't point down enough, today, I'll show you I learned from those mistakes
Somebody had told me that you got a ring, on God, I'm ready to double the wage
I'd rather do that than let a Canadian nigga make Pac turn in his grave
Cutthroat business, you got shit twisted
What is it? The braids?
I hurt your feelings? You don't wanna work with me no more? Okay
It's three GOATs left, and I seen two of them kissin' and huggin' on stage
I love 'em to death, and in eight bars, I'll explain that phrase, huh
It's nothin' nobody can tell me, huh
I don't wanna talk on no celly, huh
You know I got language barriers, huh
It's no accent you can sell me, huh
Yeah, Cole and Aubrey know I'm a selfish nigga, the crown is heavy, huh
I pray they my real friends, if not, I'm YNW Melly
I don't like you poppin' shit at Pharrell, for him, I inherit the beef
Yeah, fuck all that pushin' P, let me see you push a T
You better off spinnin' again on him, you think about pushin' me
He's Terrence Thornton, I'm Terence Crawford, yeah, I'm whoopin' feet
We ain't gotta get personal, this a friendly fade, you should keep it that way
I know some shit about niggas that make Gunna Wunna look like a saint
This ain't been about critics, not about gimmicks, not about who the greatest
It's always been about love and hate, now let me say I'm the biggest hater
I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress
I hate the way that you sneak diss, if I catch flight, it's gon' be direct
We hate the bitches you fuck 'cause they confuse themself with real women
And notice, I said ""we,"" it's not just me, I'm what the culture feelin'
How many more fairytale stories 'bout your life 'til we had enough?
How many more Black features 'til you finally feel that you're Black enough?
I like Drake with the melodies, I don't like Drake when he act tough
You gon' make a nigga bring back Puff, let me see if Chubbs really crash somethin'
Yeah, my first one like my last one, it's a classic, you don't have one
Let your core audience stomach that, then tell 'em where you get your abs from
V12, it's a fast one, baow-baow-baow, last one
Headshot for the year, you better walk around like Daft Punk
Remember?
Ayy, Top Dawg, who the fuck they think they playin' with?
Extortion my middle name as soon as you jump off of that plane, bitch
I'm allergic to the lame shit, only you like bein' famous
Yachty can't give you no swag neither, I don't give a fuck 'bout who you hang with
I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress
Surprised you wanted that feature request, you know that we got some shit to address
I even hate when you say the word ""nigga,"" but that's just me, I guess
Some shit just cringeworthy, it ain't even gotta be deep, I guess
Still love when you see success, everything with me is blessed
Keep makin' me dance, wavin' my hand, and it won't be no threat
I'm knowin' they call you The Boy, but where is a man? 'Cause I ain't seen him yet
Matter fact, I ain't even bleed him yet, can I bleed him? 
When I see you stand by Sexyy Red, I believe you see two bad bitches
I believe you don't like women, it's real competition, you might pop ass with 'em
Let's speak on percentage, show me your splits, I'll make sure I double back with ya
You were signed to a nigga that's signed to a nigga that said he was signed to that nigga
Try cease and desist on the ""Like That"" record?
Ho, what? You ain't like that record?
""Back To Back,"" I like that record
I'ma get back to that, for the record
Why would I call around tryna get dirt on niggas? Y'all think all my life is rap?
That's ho shit, I got a son to raise, but I can see you don't know nothin' 'bout that
Wakin' him up, know nothin' 'bout that
Then tell him to pray, know nothin' 'bout that
Then givin' him tools to walk through life like day by day, know nothin' 'bout that
Teachin' him morals, integrity, discipline, listen, man, you don't know nothin' 'bout that
Speakin' the truth and consider what God's considerin', you don't know nothin' 'bout that
Ain't twenty-v-one, it's one-v-twenty if I gotta smack niggas that write with you
Yeah, bring 'em out too, I'll clean 'em out too, tell BEAM that he better stay right with you
Am I battlin' ghost or AI?
Nigga feelin' like Joe Hale Osteen
Funny, he was in a film called 
A.I
And my sixth sense tellin' me to off him
I'ma blick niggas all in they coffin
Yeah, OV-ho niggas is dick riders
Tell 'em run to America to imitate heritage, they can't imitate this violence
What I learned is niggas don't like the West Coast, and I'm fine with it, I'll push the line with it
Pick a nigga off one at a time with it
We can be on a three-hour time difference
Don't speak on the family, crodie
It can get deep in the family, crodie
Talk about me and my family, crodie?
Someone gon' bleed in your family, crodie
I be at New Ho King eatin' fried rice with a dip sauce and a blammy, crodie
Tell me you're cheesin', fam
We can do this right now on the camera, crodie
Ayy, fuck y'all niggas, I don't trust y'all niggas
I wave one finger and thump y'all niggas like mmm
Field goal, punt y'all niggas, they punk y'all niggas, nobody never took my food
Whoever that's fuckin' with him, fuck you niggas, and fuck the industry too
If you take it there, I'm takin' it further
Psst, that's something you don't wanna do
Ooh
We don't wanna hear you say ""nigga"" no more
We don't wanna hear you say ""nigga"" no more
Stop"

Indian Scout
It was black like his jacket
American Spirit hangin' outta his mouth
Just like our daddy
He kick-started that bike one night and broke mama's heart
He pointed that headlight West
, 
out where the wild things are
He'd call me up every couple of weeks
From South California
Talk about the desert and the 
Joshua Tree
And his pretty girl stories
And how he bought an 
Airstream trailer
 and a 
J-45 guitar
Said, ""Little brother, you'd love it out here, out where the wild things are""
Oh, oh-oh, it's hearts on fire and crazy dreams
Oh, oh-oh, 
the nights ignite like gasoline
And light up those streets that never sleep when the sky goes dark
Out where the wild things are
I called my brother from the back of that plane
The second I made it
We started drinkin' on the strip in L.A
And then it got crazy
Ended up at a house in the hills with some Hollywood stars
Kissin' on a blonde in a backyard pool, out where the wild things are
Couple iron horse rebels
Wild as the devil
I knew I had to move back East
Said goodbye to my brother
At the end of that summer
But I knew he'd never leave
Oh, oh-oh, it's hearts on fire and crazy dreams
Oh, where the nights ignite like gasoline
And oh, oh-oh, 
them Indian Scouts, man, they're built for speed
And oh, oh-oh, 
they said he hit that guard rail at half past three
Lit up those streets that never sleep when the sky goes dark
We buried him out in the wind 'neath the West Coast stars
Out where the wild things are
Out where the wild things are"

So if I say I'm fine
Just know I learned to hide it well
I know I can't be the only one

I'm not okay
But it's all gonna be alright
It's not okay

I almost stayed in bed
Had the devil on my back
And voices in my head
Some days, it ain't all bad
Some days, it all gets worse
Some days, I swear I'm better off
Layin' in that dirt
I know I can't be the only one

Gonna bе alright

We'll see the other side
The pain'll wash away
In a holy water tide
And we all gonna be alright

I got too much pride to let that happen again
So this is where it ends, ends, ends
Yeah, this is where it ends
You're the best thing that ever happened to me
You showed me what true love shouldn't be
I found myself the second I gave up on us
You're the last thing that I thought I'd lose
All I ever wanted was to be loved by you
I let you back in and I gave you a second chance 
And like a jet plane on a clear blue sky
Sun came shinin' down on all your lies
I got too much pride to let that happen again
So this is where it ends"

I wasn't there, but I know
She was your girl
You showed her the world

She was cryin’ on my shoulder
All I could do was hold her
Only made us closer until July
Now, I know that you love me
You don't need to remind me
I should put it all behind me, shouldn't I?
But I see her in the back of my mind all the time
Like a fever, like I’m burning alive, like a sign
Did I cross the line?
 Hmm
Well, good things don't last 
And life moves so fast 
I'd never ask who was better 
'Cause she couldn't be 
More different from me 
Happy and free in leather 
And I know that you love me 
You don’t need to remind me 
Wanna put it all behind me, but baby
I see her in the back of my mind  all the time 
Feels like a fever , like I’m burning alive , like a sign
Did I cross the line?
You say no one knows you so well 
But every time you touch me, I just wonder how she felt
Valentine's Day, cryin’ in the hotel
I know you didn't mean to hurt me, so I kept it to myself
And I wonder
Do you see her in the back of your mind in my eyes?

Finds the beauty in the thrown away and broken things
Gets excited about all my crazy dreams
Got every sunset that she's ever seen memorized
Saves them away for a rainy day or stormy night
The sky is brighter lookin' at it through her eyes
I don't remember
Life before she came into the picture
Brought the beauty I was missin' with her
Showed me colors I ain't ever seen
She took chances
With every wall I built, she saw a canvas
I thank God every day for how He made her
My life was black and white, but she's the painter
She reminds me that it ain't too late to start again
Fine is good, but you need some blue every now and then
How'd I live so long without her reckless touch?

My heart could be burnin', but you won't see it on my face
Watch me dance , dance the night away 
I'll still keep the party runnin', not one hair out of place
When my heart breaks 
When my world shakes 
I don't play safe, don't you know about me? 
I could dance, I could dance, I could dance
Dance the night"
