Hmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Let me talk to 'em, let me talk to 'em
Let it 
ring
Hmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Let me talk to 'em (
Come on
)
Shawty had them Apple Bottom jeans , boots with the fur 
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the flo' , next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low
Them baggy sweatpants and the Reeboks with the straps 
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack 
She hit the flo' , next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low
Hey, I ain't never seen nothin' that'll make me go
This crazy all night spendin' my dough
Had a million dollar vibe and a bottle to go
Them birthday cakes they stole the show
So sexual, she was flexible
Professional, 
drinkin' X and O
Hold up, wait a minute, do I see what I think I, woah
Did I think I see shawty get low?
Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain, I'm makin' it snow
Work the pole, I got the bank roll
I'ma say that I prefer them no clothes
I'm into that, I love women exposed
She threw it back at me, I gave her mo'
Cash ain't no problem, I know where it goes
She had them
Apple Bottom jeans , boots with the fur 
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the flo' , next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low
Them baggy sweatpants and the Reeboks with the straps 
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack 
She hit the flo' , next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low
Hey, shawty, what I gotta do to get you home?
My jeans full of guap and they ready for shones
Cadillacs, Maybachs for the sexy groan
Patron on the rocks that'll make you moan
One stack c'mon, two stacks c'mon
Three stacks c'mon, now that's three grand
What, you think I'm playin', baby girl?
I'm the man, I invented rubber bands
That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulder
I knew it was over, that Henny and Cola
Got me like a soldier, she ready for Rover
I couldn't control her
So lucky oh me, I was just like a clover
Shawty was hot like a toaster
Sorry but I had to fold her
Like a pornography poster, she showed her
Apple Bottom jeans , boots with the fur 
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the flo' , next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low
Them baggy sweatpants and the Reeboks with the straps 
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack 
She hit the flo' , next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low
Woah, shawty
Yeah, she was worth the money
Lil' mama took my cash and I ain't want it back
The way she bent that back, got her them paper stacks
Tattoo above her crack, I had to handle that
I was on it, sexy woman
Let me showin' and made me want it
Two in the mornin', I'm zonin' and them Rosé bottles foamin'
She wouldn't stop, made it drop
Shawty did that pop and lock
Had to break her off that guap
Gal was fly just like my Glock
Apple Bottom jeans , boots with the fur 
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the flo' , next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low
Them baggy sweatpants and the Reeboks with the straps 
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack 
She hit the flo' , next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low "
2,"""Bleeding Love""",Leona Lewis,https://genius.com/Leona-lewis-bleeding-love-lyrics,"Hey
Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen, ooh
But somethin' happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground, found somethin' true
And everyone's lookin' 'round thinkin' I'm going crazy
Ooh, yeah
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closin'
You cut me open and I
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleedin'
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open
Mm, yeah
Tryin' hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercin' sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from fallin', ooh, yeah
But nothin's greater than the rush that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closin'
You cut me open and I
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleedin'
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open, mmh
And it's drainin' all of me
Though they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearin' these scars for everyone to see
I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closin'
Ooh, you cut me open and I
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleedin'
I keep, keep bleeding love 
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
Oh, you cut me open and I
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love 
I keep bleedin'
I keep, keep bleeding love 
Keep bleedin' 
Keep, keep bleeding love
Ooh, you cut me open and I
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love

3,"""No One""",Alicia Keys,https://genius.com/Alicia-keys-no-one-lyrics,"I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better
You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking, they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain
You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking, they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you
Can get in the way of what I feel
I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know people will try, try to divide, something so real
So 'til the end of time, I'm telling you there ain't
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one

To breathe easy for a while
The breathing gets harder, even I know that
Made room for me, it's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold on to
Blank stares at blank pages
No easy way to say this
You mean well, but you make this hard on me
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leavin', I'ma need a better reason
To write you a love song today
 Today, yeah
I learned the hard way that they all say
Things you wanna hear
And my heavy heart sinks deep down under you
And your twisted words, your help just hurts
You are not what I thought you were
Hello to high and dry
Convinced me to please you
Made me think that I need this too
I'm trying to let you hear me as I am
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one

Promise me
That you'll leave the light on
To help me see
With daylight, my guide, gone
'Cause I believe there's a way
You can love me because I say...
I won't write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song 
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this, huh
Is that why you wanted a love song? 
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song 
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this

Gaze in your eyes, got me saying, ""What a beautiful lady""
No ifs, ands or maybes

Trying to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry

And don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not
Baby, when I know you're only sorry you got caught
But you put on quite a show 
Really had me going
But, now, it's time to go 
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show 
Very entertaining
But it's over now 
Go on and take a bow
Oh, oh
Grab your clothes and get gone 
You better hurry up
Before the sprinklers come on 
Talkin' 'bout ""Girl, I love you, you're the one""
This just looks like a rerun
Please, what else is on? 
And don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not

But it's over now 
Go on and take a bow
Oh, and the award for the best liar goes to you 
For making me believe
That you could be faithful to me
Let's hear your speech, oh
How 'bout a round of applause?

Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the mornin', I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead, long live the king""
One minute, I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (
Mmm, mmm
)
Aw, who would ever wanna be king?
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it
Us girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it"

But we are hidin' in a safer place
Under covers, stayin' dry and warm

The truth is a stranger, soul is in danger
I gotta let my spirit be free
To admit that I'm wrong
And then change my mind
Sorry, but I have to move on
And leave you behind
I can't waste time, so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken
No need to worry 'bout everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back at a new direction
I loved you once, needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart just like a tattoo
Just like a tattoo
I'll always have you

It's not about taking sides
When I looked in the mirror

It hurt enough to think that I could stop

Untie the weight bags, I never thought I could
Steady feet, don't fail me now

Consider them my protege, homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way

It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away

If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game, but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'

Scared to moan 'round you, so all I can say is ""ooh""

She like to spell her name wit her tongue on my chest
If you'd of told me it was this good, I'd of never guessed
She full of surprises, I don't know what she'll do next
But while she sleep I sneak and put hickies on her neck
And when she go out, she shut down the whole set
Love to see her in heels wit the slit in her dress
She like to do her own hair and get her own checks
My bust it baby, I keep her on deck

In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song""
And he says
Our song is a slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everythin' that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said
Our song is a slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again
Da-da-da-da
I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for somethin' to come along
That was as good as our song
'Cause our song is a slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss him and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again
Play it again, oh, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song"

I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
'Cause I don't write shit, 'cause I ain't got time
'Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers, ""Ha-ha-ha-ha

You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em 'cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower

To be everything that I've been looking for
I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted
The time you may have here with me
'Cause Lord only knows another day here's not really guaranteed
So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
Every time you touch me
Touch me like this is the last time
Promise that you'll love me
Love me like you'll never see me again
Oh oh oh
How many really know what love is?
Millions never will
Do you know until you lose it?
That it's everything that we are looking for
When I wake up in the morning
And you're beside me
I'm so thankful that I found
Everything that I've been looking for
I don't wanna forget the present is a gift

And she's got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
So I'll drive home alone as I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

I fake a smile, so he won't see"

And I promised myself that I'd do anything (

Anything at all for them to notice me (

You damn right, I'm gon' beep
So I approached the chick with the real pretty face
Big-ass booty with a little-bitty waist
I whispered in her ear, ""Lil' mama, what you drink?
I know that you a freak, but you know I ain't gon' say shit""
See, my game is outrageous
I got her to the crib and exchanged some fuck-faces
But it wasn't no use for me to rush to bust one
'Cause I wanted her to have a eruption

I close both blinds and turn away
Sometimes solutions aren't so simple
Sometimes goodbye's the only way, oh
And the sun will set for you
The sun will set for you
And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in gray
And the sun will set for you
In cards and flowers on your window
Your friends all plead for you to stay
Sometimes beginnings aren't so simple
Sometimes goodbye's the only way, oh
And the sun will set for you
The sun will set for you
And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in gray
And the sun will set for you
And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in gray
And the sun will set for you
And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in gray

Lil Wayne

Some live for the bill, some kill for the bill 
She whined for the bill,
 grind for the bill 
 
And she used to be the sweetest girl
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay they bill 
And she used to be the sweetest girl
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy on the bill 
[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean &

High school, she was that girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym
High school she was that girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym
Never thought that she would come and work for the president
Mr. George Washington 
She balls
He calls 
She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day
All he wanna know is 
Closed legs don't get fed, go out there and make my bread
All he wanna know is 
She ended up in the wrong car, bruised up, scarred hard
All he wanna know is 
She balls
He calls

'Cause I'ma tell you like Wu told me
Cash Rules Everything Around Me
Singin' dollar, dollar bill, y'all 
Singin' dollar, dollar bill, y'all 
Pimpin' got harder 'cause hoes got smarter
On the strip is somethin' they don't wanna be a part of
Rather be up in the club, shakin' for a dub
Get triple times the money and spendin' it like they wanna 
They got they mind on they money, money on they mind
They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the 9
See, everyday they feel the struggle but stayin' on they grind
And ain't nobody takin' from us, and that's the bottom line
But I know there's a drop in the block
You move slow, you gettin' pressure from cops
You don't know whether or not to lay low
'Cause 25 to life's no joke
To all my real guerillas thuggin' 
On top of corners every day strugglin' 
All the beautiful women's gettin' money 
Washin' them dollar bills like laundry
I'ma tell you like Wu told me
Cash Rules Everything Around Me
Singin' dollar, dollar bill, y'all 
Singin' dollar, dollar bill, y'all

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne, 
Niia

Lil Wayne & Wyclef Jean

She used to be the sweetest girl 
ever
, whatever
Now she like sour 
amaretto
She wears a dress to the T like the 
letter
And if you make it rain, she will be under the weather 
She used to run track back in 
high school
Now she tricks on the track right by school
She take the loss 'cause she don't wanna see her child 
lose
So respect her, or pay up for the time 
used
And then she runs to the 
pastor
And he tells her there will be a new 
chapter
But she feels no different after
And then she ask him: ""Where my money at?""
See, I'ma tell you like Wu told me
Cash Rules Everything Around Me

tonight will be the night that I will fall for you over again
Don't make me change my mind

I always swore to you I'd never fall apart
You always thought that I was stronger
I may have failed, but I have loved you from the start

Don't make me change my mind
Or I won't live to see another day, I swear it's true

Breathe me in, I'm yours to keep
And hold on to your words 'cause talk is cheap
And remember me tonight when you're asleep

And they wanna know, oh, oh, oh (

And the lights are on (

And they want a show, oh, oh, oh, yeah (
Free Chilly
)
Yeah, uh, a fresh cool young Lu'
Tryna cash his microphone check, two-one-two
Wanna believe my own hype, but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees; ""What have you brung? You?
Did you improve on a design? Did you do something new?
Well, your name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You—the more famous person—you come through
And the sexy lady next to you, come too!""
And then it hit me, standing outside of Heaven
Waiting for God to come and get me: I'm too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules and too gumshoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle, I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who sung blue
""Go back, whatever you did, you undo.""
Heavy as Heaven, the Devil on me, two tons too
Ha, ha, ha, ha-ha-ha
If you are what you say you are
A superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones
And they wanna know, oh, oh, oh, yeah
And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down through the basement, past the Indian graves
Where the dinosaurs laid and 
Out through China, nearly misses airliners
Magnified times five, this was pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze 
Now, that's important to say
'Cause even with all that, most of us don't want it to fade
We want it to braid
Meaning we want it to grow, meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called, and he told him to wait
Unstrap him from the chair, put him back in his cage
The audience ain't fazed
And they ain't gon' clap, and they ain't gon' praise 
They want everything back  that they've paid
'Cause they've been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim
Ha, ha, ha, ha-ha-ha
If you are what you say you are
A superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show, oh, oh, oh, yeah
So, chauffeur, chauffeur, come and take me away
'Cause I've been standing in this line for, like, five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along, and when I got to the front
They told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every song's her favorite song; and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say, ""You need to go and see that!""
And everybody claps, 'cause everybody is pleased
And then, they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like, ""Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha""
""Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha, ha""
[Chorus: Matthew Santos &

Let it rock , let it rock , let it rock 
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne, 
Kevin Rudolf

Yeoaw!
Wayne's World, Planet Rock
Panties drop, and the tops
And she gonna rock 'til the camera stop
And I sing about angels like Angela (
Rock
!)
And Pamela (
Rock!
) and Samantha (
Rock!
)
And Amanda and Tamara,
 
ménage à moi
I'm in here like, ""Bitch, what's up?""
Mechanic, me, I can fix you up
I can dick you up, I can dick you down
Shorty, we can go wherever, just pick a town
And my jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big-ass rocks like on the ground
Dirty like socks that's on the ground, Weezy
Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What the saints forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Just let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Let it rock
Let it rock
I'm back like I forgot somethin', I'm somethin'
Ruling rock rubbin' rap running
Miles like I'm trying to get a flat stomach
Like Wayne the personal trainer
My aim is perfect, I'll bang ya
Period, like the reminder
And I wish I could be as cruel as you
And I wish I could say the things you do
But I can't and I won't live a lie
No, not this time"

Got my old school bumpin', hip wheel on recline
If you think a nigga broke, you out'cha monkey-ass mind 
Diamonds on my pinky , 
hand on the pine
Bitch, you touch and die, your momma do the second line
Screens fallin' from the sky, syrup fallin' in my cup
Old school Chevy thang, comin' down, nigga, what?
Got diamonds in my mouth , got some Gucci on my seat
Got G's on my ass, 
bitch, it's cold when I speak
Got a freak on my arm, got a charm around my neck
You can gon' pass the mic, watch I'm 'bout to catch wreck
Still screamin' out mayne , pistol in my hand
Southside so throwed 
Big face on my chain,

Big bodies comin' down, hoggin' up both lanes

This rap money's okay, but

And this cartoon cash

My Bentley's hatin' on that ass, my old school's gettin' pissed
She opened up her arm, but then she slit both wrists
There go them

, wood on the dash
Ferris wheels on the toes 
 and got

And some chrome on the nose , the white boys go, ""Sweet""
But Black folks go, ""Oh,"" I got a 'llac full of ammo
I'm brick with the nine throwin' bombs out the Lambo' 
The butterflies goin' up
I got Chad in my heart

Until I let go, gave into love
And watched all the bitterness burn
Now I'm comin' alive, body and soul
Feelin' my world start to turn
And I'll taste every moment and live it out loud

Holdin' onto things that vanished into the air
Left me in pieces
But now I'm risin' from the ashes
Finding my wings
And all that I needed
Was there all along within' my reach
As close as the beat of my heart
And I'll taste every moment and live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time to be

I know this is the time, this is the time of my life

Keeping your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, you lose
I'm not loving you way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
Know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
Keep it on the roll, only God knows
If I'll be with you, baby, I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not loving you way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I've been down this road too many times before
I'm not loving you way I wanted to
So keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, you lose
You lose
You lose
You lose

I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Oh, oh
But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said
""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""

85,"""All Summer Long""",Kid Rock,https://genius.com/Kid-rock-all-summer-long-lyrics,"It was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man, I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Catching walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll
While we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
""Sweet Home Alabama"" oh yeah
Turn it up!
Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along
And think man I'd love to see that girl again
 Yeah
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long

To try to get you thinking they really care
But there's nothing like the warmth of the one
Who has put in the time and you know is gonna be there
Back your border when she knows someone crossed it
Don't let nobody put you down, who you're with
Take the pain of protecting your name
From the 
crutch to the cane to the high wire
I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands
And she knows how to treat a fella right
Gives me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me
I'm in love with a girl 
I'm in love with a girl 
Out the many broken back doors and windows
Through the valley of the love of the lost
Is a hole that has cut through the souls
Fallen down from the tones without reading innuendos
And they found inner peace for the moment
The moment was over in time
Then it's gone, the hit and run
The drifters fun has a short life
I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands
And she knows how to treat a fella right
Gives me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me
I'm in love with a girl 
I'm in love with a girl 
I wanna tell you what you do to thank you
Practice what you preach
And now I know there's nothing we can't reach
'Cause a heart can't erase once it's found a place
To be warm and welcome
To be held and sheltered
I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands
And she knows how to treat a fella right
Give me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me
I'm in love with a girl 
I'm in love with a girl 
I'm in love with a girl

""You ain't grindin' until you tired""
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide

I'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doin' right?

Take me away from the hood, like a state penitentiary
Take me away from the hood, in a casket or a Bentley
Take me away
Like I overdosed on cocaine
Or take me away like a bullet from Kurt Cobain
Suicide, I'm from a windy city like Do or Die
From a block close to where Biggie was crucified
That was Brooklyn's Jesus, shot for no fuckin' reason
And you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces?
 
‘Cause that's Jesus' people
And Game, he's the equal
Hated on so much, 
Passion of Christ

Like Roc-A-Fella needed Sigel

like I needed my father
But he needed a needle
 
I need some meditation so I can lead my people
They askin', ""Why
Why did John Lennon leave The Beatles?""
And why every hood nigga feed off evil?
Answer my question 'fore this bullet leave this Desert Eagle

So approach my Phantom doors with caution
You see them 24s spinnin'? I earned 'em
And I ain't no preacher, but here's my Erick Sermon
So eat this black music and tell me how it taste now
And fuck Jesse Jackson, ‘cause it ain't about race now
Sometimes I think about my life, with my face down
Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile 
Damn, I know his mama proud, and since you helped me sell my dream
We can share my mama now
And like M.J.B., no more drama now
Livin' the good life, me and Common on common ground
I spit crack and niggas could drive it out of town
Got a Chris Paul mind state, I'm never out of bounds
My life used to be empty, like a Glock without a round
Now my life full like a chopper with a thousand rounds
And I'm grindin' 'til I'm tired ‘cause they said
""You ain't grindin' until you tired""

With the high beams on, me and the devil sharin' chronic blunts
Listenin' to the

Playin' backwards, shootin' at pictures of Don Imus for target practice
My mind fucked up, so I cover it with a Raider hood
I'm from the city that made you motherfuckers afraid of Suge 
Made my grandmother pray for good, it never made her happy
But I bet that new Mercedes could 
Ain't no bars, but niggas can't escape the hood
And it took so many of my niggas that I should hate the hood
But it's real niggas like me that make the hood
Ridin' slow in that Phantom just the way I should 
With the top back
In my Sox hat
I'm paid in full, the nigga Alpo couldn't stop that
Even if they brought the nigga Pac back
I still keep this motherfucker cocked back
And I'm grindin' 'til I'm tired ‘cause they said
""You ain't grindin' until you tired""
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find, a way through the day, a light for the night

Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But love remains the same
Find the place where we escape
Take you with me for the space

I walk the streets through seven bars
I had to find just where you are

Pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But love remains the same
So much more to say
So much to be done
Don't you trick me out
We shall overcome
So all have stayed in place
We should've had the sun
Could've been inside
'Stead, we're over here
Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending
Too much time, too long defending
You and I have done pretending
I never thought that I had any more to give
Pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
Everything will change
I, oh, I, I wish this could last forever
I, oh, I, as if we could last forever
Love remains the same
Love remains the same"
95,"""Feels Like Tonight""",Daughtry,https://genius.com/Daughtry-feels-like-tonight-lyrics,"You, you got me
Thinking it'll be alright
You, you told me
""Come and take a look inside""
You believe me
In every single lie
But I, I failed you this time
And it feels like tonight
I can't believe I'm broken inside
Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight
Tonight
I was waiting
For the day you'd come around
I was chasing
But nothing was all I found
From the moment you came into my life
You showed me what's right
And it feels like tonight
I can't believe I'm broken inside
Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight
I never felt like this before
Just when I leave, I'm back for more
Nothing else here seems to matter
In these ever-changing days
You're the one thing that remains
I could stay like this forever
And it feels like tonight
I can't believe I'm broken inside
Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight
Tonight 
Tonight 
'Cause there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight
Tonight"

I can't even buy you flowers
But together, we can be the perfect soulmates
Talk to me, girl

If we go Dutch, you can still touch my love, it's free 
We can work without the perks, just you and me

All the things you do

So as for you, well, you know where to go
I wanna take my love and hate you 'til the end

98,"""Into the Night""",Santana featuring Chad Kroeger,https://genius.com/Santana-into-the-night-lyrics,"Like a gift from the heavens, it was easy to tell
It was love from above, that could save me from hell
She had fire in her soul, it was easy to see
How the devil himself could be pulled out of me
There were drums in the air as she started to dance
Every soul in the room keeping time with their hands
And we sang
Aye-oh-aye, oh, aye-oh-aye
And the voices rang like the angels sing
We're singing
Aye-oh-aye, oh, aye-oh-aye
And we danced on into the night
And we danced on into the night
Like a piece to the puzzle that falls into place
You could tell how we felt from the look on our faces
We were spinning in circles with the moon in our eyes
No room left to move in-between you I
We forgot where we were and we lost track of time
And we sang to the wind as we danced through the night
And we sang
Aye-oh-aye, oh, aye-oh-aye
And the voices rang like the angels sing
We're singing
Aye-oh-aye, oh, aye-oh-aye
And we danced on into the night
And we danced on into the night
And we danced on into the night
Like a gift from the heavens, it was easy to tell
It was love from above, that could save me from hell

Sent from heaven
Now you can wait your whole life wondering
When it's gonna come or where it's been
You may have got your heart broken a few times in the past
Never last strong as it used to
It don't feel as good as it used to before
And all the things you used to say
Things you used to do, went right out the door
Ooh, no more, will you be the one
That's what you tell everyone around you
But you know they've heard it all before
What more can you say?
When love won't let you, walk away 
And you can't help who you love 
And you find yourself giving it away
When you think you're in love, ooh, 'cause
I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from 
 
And there's a piece of me who leaves when you're gone
Because you're sent from 
 
I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from 
And there's a piece of me who leaves when you're gone
Because you're sent from 
Now you can wait your whole life tryna change
What the fear from what it's been
You may have put your whole life into a man
Loving what you thought that could've been
Notice when you change
When you don't feel as good as you used to before
And everything you used to say
Everything you used to do clear right out the door
Ooh, no more, will you be the one
That's what you tell everyone around you
But you know they've heard it all before
What more can you say?
When love won't let you, walk away
And you can't help who you love
And you find yourself giving it away
When you think you're in love, 'cause I wanna be, hey, yeah
I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from 
 
And there's a piece of me who leaves when you're gone
Because you're sent from 
 
I wanna be the one who you believe 
In your heart is sent from 
 
And there's a piece of me who leaves when you're gone 
Because you're sent from 
And everybody say I wanna be the one you love
I wanna be the one you love 
Everybody say I wanna be the one you trust
I wanna be the one you trust 
Everybody say I wanna be the one you need
