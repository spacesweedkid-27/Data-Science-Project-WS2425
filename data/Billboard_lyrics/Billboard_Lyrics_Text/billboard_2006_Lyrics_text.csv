1,"""Bad Day""",Daniel Powter,https://genius.com/Daniel-powter-bad-day-lyrics,"Where is the moment we needed the most?
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to gray
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carryin' on
You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carryin' on
Because you had a bad day, you're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know, you tell me, don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day, the camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day
Well, you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carryin' on
You had a bad day, you're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know, you tell me, don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day, the camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
Ooh, a holiday
Sometimes, the system goes on the blink and the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know that you could be, well, oh, that strong
And I'm not wrong
Yeah, yeah, yeah
So where is the passion when you need it the most?
Oh, you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
'Cause you had a bad day, you're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know, you tell me, don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day, you've seen what you're like
And how does it feel? One more time
You had a bad day
You had a bad day 
Had a bad day 
Had a bad day 
Had a bad day "

Am I throwin' you off?
Nope
Didn't think so
[Verse 1: Timbaland & 
Nelly Furtado
]
How you doin', young lady?
That feelin' that you're givin' really drives me crazy
You're dope, have a player 'bout to choke
I was at a loss for words first time that we spoke
You lookin' for a girl that'll treat you right?
You lookin' for her in the daytime with the light?
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night
You expect me to just let you hit it?
But will you still respect me if you get it?
All I can do is try, gimme one chance 
What's the problem? I don't see the ring on your hand 
I'll be the first to admit it
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent
You
 wanna get in my world, get lost in it?
Boy, I'm tired of runnin', let's walk for a minute
[Chorus 1: Nelly Furtado & 
Timbaland
]
Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, you already know
That I'm all yours, what you waitin' for?
Promiscuous girl

You know what I want, and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, let's get to the point
'Cause we're on a roll, you ready?

Timbaland

Roses are red, some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead, but you're still kinda cute
Hey, I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at? Do you mind if I come through?
I'm out of this world, come with me to my planet
Get you on my level, do you think that you can handle it?
They call me Thomas, last name Crown
Recognize game, I'ma lay mine's down
I'm a big girl, I can handle myself
But if I get lonely, I'ma need your help
Pay attention to me, I don't talk for my health
I want you on my team
 -- So does everybody else
Shh, baby, we can keep it on the low
 (
Low
)
Let your guard down, ain't nobody gotta know
 (
Know
)
If you with it, girl, I know a place we can go
What kind of girl do you take me for?

I'm all alone, and it's you that I want

Wait, I don't mean no harm
I can see you with my t-shirt on
I can see you with nothin' on
Feelin' on me before you bring that on
Bring that on?!
 -- You know what I mean
Girl, I'm a freak, you shouldn't say those things
I'm only tryna get inside of your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say
It's okay, it's all right
I got somethin' that you gon' like
Hey, is that the truth, or are you talkin' trash?
Is your game M.V.P. like Steve Nash?

Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, I'm callin' your name

My life is brilliant
My love is pure
I saw an angel
Of that I'm sure
She smiled at me on the subway
She was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that
'Cause I've got a plan
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you
Yes, she caught my eye
As I walked on by
She could see from my face that I was
Fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last till the end
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you
Ba, la, la, na
Ba, la, la, na
Ba, la, la, na, na
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
There must be an angel with a smile on her face
When she thought up that I should be with you
But it's time to face the truth
I will never be with you"

Hey, girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy

Refugees run the seas, 'cause we own our own boats, boats

Yeah, I was out of touch

I just knew too much, mm
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly
And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice, mm

Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha, ha, ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?
Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on the limb
And all I remember is thinkin' I wanna be like them, mhm
Ever since I was little
Ever since I was little, it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Grindin' to see if they can see me lean
I'm tint, so it ain't easy to be seen
Police see me ride by, they can see me gleam
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen
I'm ridin' with a new chick, she like, ""Hold up!""
Next to the PlayStation controller
It's a full 
clip
 in my pistola
Send a jacker into a coma 
Girl, you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryna bone, ain't tryna have no babies
Ride clean as hell so I pull in ladies
Law's on patrol and you know they hate me
Music turned all the way up into the maximum
I got speakers, some niggas tryna jack for some
But we packin' somethin' and what we have for 'em
We'll have a nigga locked up in the maximum
Security cell, I'm grippin' oak 
Music loud and I'm tippin' slow 
Twin's steady twistin' like, ""Hit this though!""
Police pull up right behind and it's in his throat
The windows down, got to stop pollution
CD change, niggas like, ""Who is that producin'?""
That's the Play-N-Skillz when we out and cruisin'
Got warrants in every city except Houston but I still ain't losin'

Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
I've been drinkin' and smokin'
Holy shit, cause I really can't focus
I gotta get it home 'fore the po-po's scope this
Big old Excurs' just swervin'
, all up in the curb and
Nigga be sippin' on the Hennessy and the gin again
It's in again, we in the wind
Doin' a hundred while I puff on a blunt and roll another one up
We livin' like we ain't givin' a fuck
I got a blunt up in my right hand
40-ounce in my lap freezin' my balls
Roll another tree, green leaves and all
Comin' pretty deep, me and my dawgs
Yo, I gotta hit the back streets
Wonderin' 'bout the six pounds and I got heat
Glock, Glock shots to the block, we creep-creep
Pop-pop, hope cops don't see me, on the lowkey
With no regard for the law
We dodge 'em like, ""Fuck 'em all""
But I won't get caught up and brought up
On charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car, and a blunt to spark
Roll it up if you want, and get it poppin', dawg
Ready or not, we bust shots off in the air

Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Now would you think it's so? I tried to let you go
Turn on my blinker light and then I swang it slow
And they upset for sho', 'cause they think they know
That they catchin' me with plenty of the drank and dro
So they get behind me, tryna check my tags
Look in my rearview and they smilin'
Thinkin' they'll catch me in the wrong, they keep tryin'
Keep steady denyin' that it's racial profilin'
Houston, Texas, you can check my tags 
Pull me over, try to check my slab 
The glove compartment, gotta get my cash
Cause the crooked cops'll try to come up fast
And bein' the baller that I am, I talk to them
Givin' a damn about them not feelin' my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin' dirty
Bet you'll be leavin' with an even madder mood
I'ma laugh at you and then I'll have to cruise
Jammin' number two on some old DJ Screw
You can't arrest me, plus you can't sue
This is a message to the law, tell 'em, ""We hate you""
I can't be touched and tell 'em that they shoulda known
Tippin' down, I'm sittin' crooked on my chrome
Bookin' my phone, findin' a chick I wanna bone
Like they couldn't stop me, I'm 'bout to pull up at your home
And it's on
They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty

All invisible set in little ice cube blocks
If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on the rocks
If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white rose, traditional gold
I'm changin' grills every day, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely , 
in my white tee
 
Or on South Beach , in my wife beat
VVS studded, you can tell when they cut it
You see, my grandmama hate it, but my lil' mama love it
'Cause when I
Open up your mouth, your grill gleamin'
 
Eyes stay low from the chiefin'
 
I got a grill I call penny candy, you know what that mean?
It look like Now and Laters, gumdrops, jelly beans

My teeth gleaming like I'm chewing on aluminum foil
Smiling, showing off my diamonds, sippin' on some potent oil 
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
Twenty carats, thirty stacks, let 'em know I'm so for real 
My motivation is them thirty pointers, VVS
The frontage in my mouthpiece simply symbolize success (
That's right

I got the wristwear and neckwear that's captivating 
But it's my smile that got these onlookers spectating 
My mouthpiece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carrots than a salad (

I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a cue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
But that's how it's gotta be
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears
And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind
Let's rearrange
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
Just say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along
But that's disregard
You find another friend and you discard
As you lose the argument in a cable car
Hanging above as the canyon comes between
And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind
Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on, on
And suddenly
I've become a part of your past
I'm becoming the part that don't last
I'm losing you and it's effortless
Without a sound
We lose sight of the ground in the throw around
Never thought that you wanted to bring it down
I won't let it go down 'til we torch it ourselves
And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind
Everyone knows
She's on your mind
Everyone knows I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head, I'm over my—
Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head

And shawty know I mean what I say so she won't stop doing that

Well dance time is us, let's go, let's go 
We can get it in , we can gets some friends
Do it like the Ying Yang twins, start whispering
Wait 'til you see my ayy!
Wait 'til you see my ayy!
Let me fall back, you ain't ready for all that
Have you sleep late, real late, yeah, taking a long nap 
You tell your friends to get with my friends
We can be friends, switch and meet friends
 We can do it all night long and...
'Til the clock hit morning, ya dig?

Ooh, yeah
Gotta change my answering machine
Now that I'm alone
'Cause right now it says that we
Can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense
'Cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore
It's been months
And for some reason I just 
And I'm stronger than this, yeah 
No more walking 'round with my head down 
I'm so over being blue
Cryin' over you
And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishin' you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
Gotta fix that calendar I have
That's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me of what used to be
That's the reason
I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishin' you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
 Leave me alone
 Oh-oh, hey
Don't make me think about her smile
Or having my first child
I'm letting go
Turning off the radio
'Cause I'm so sick of love songs , so tired of tears 
So done with wishin' she were still here 
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow 
So why can't I turn off the radio? 
And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears 
So done with wishing she were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow 
Why can't I turn off the radio? 
And I'm so sick of love songs 
So tired of tears 
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow

Yeah, here we go again 
Bad boy south, Ghettoville U.S.A. 
You know I go by the name Nitti, right? 
I gotta introduce you to another motherfucker out my squad, right 
This nigga go by the name of Joc (Joc?, 
Yung Joc
, yeah)
He resides in Collegepark 
But for right now, what we gotta do for y'all 
We gotta give y'all a hit 
Niggas in my face , damn near er' day 
Ask a million questions like, ""Joc, where ya' stay?"" 
Tell 'em Collegepark , where they chop cars 
Get twenty grand, spend a grand at the bar 
Just bought a zone, J's on my feet
I'm on that Patron, so get like me
'69 Cutlass , with the bucket seats 
Beat in my trunk, bought it just for the freaks 
Catch me in the hood , posted at the store 
Pistol in my lap, on the phone counting dough 
If your girl choose, let her do her thing
Just like her mama, nice ass, nice brain 
Er'body love me, I'm so fly 
Niggas throw the deuces er'time I ride by
I know you wonder why I'm so cool 
Don't ask me, just do what you do 
Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Anywhere you meet me, guaranteed to go down
Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Anywhere you meet me, guaranteed to go down
Verse number two , do the damn thing 
Cubes on my neck, pockets full of Ben Frank's 
When I'm in the mall , hoes just pause 
I pop a few tags, give me that on the wall 
Time to flip the work, make the block bump 
Boys in the hood call me black Donald Trump 
Dope boy magic , seven days a week (Uh-huh, 
seven days
)
Number one record 'long as Nitti on the beat 
Ooh, I think they like me
, better yet, I know 
Lights, camera, action, when I walk through the door 
Niggas know my crew , we certified stars 
Valet in the front, 'bout thirty-five cars 
Bitches in the back, black Beamer coupe's 
Girls liking girls , time to recruit 
If you got a problem, say it to my face 
We can knuckle up any time, any place 
Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Anywhere ya meet me, guaranteed to go down
Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Anywhere ya meet me, guaranteed to go down
Time to set it off , let these niggas know 
Have ya ever seen a Chevy with the butterfly doors? 
I ride real slow , no need to speed 
Gotta make sure you see the buckets on my feet 
Feds on my trail, but they don't think I know 
I keep my hands clean 'cause I never touch dope
 
Every time I see 'em , look 'em in they eyes 
Ask me how I know , it's me, surprise 
Put it in the air , rep where you stay 
Take a step back, blow the kush in they face 
Stuntin' is a habit, let 'em see the karats
I'ma make it rain nigga, I ain't scared to share it 
[Chorus: Yung Joc & 
Nitti
]
Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Anywhere ya meet me, guaranteed to go down
Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Anywhere ya meet me, guaranteed to go down (

Move along, move along like I know ya do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
Move along
Move along
So a day when you've lost yourself completely
Could be a night when your life ends
Such a heart that will lead you to deceiving
All the pain held in your
Hands are shaking cold
Your hands are mine to hold
Speak to me
When all you gotta keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know ya do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
Move along
When everything is wrong, we move along
When everything is wrong, we move

That don't bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let 'em out
I’m not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though goin' on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I’m okay
But that’s not what gets me
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowin’
What could've been
And not seein' that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do
It’s hard to deal with the pain of losin' you everywhere I go
But I’m doin’ it
It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone
Still harder gettin' up, gettin' dressed, livin' with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart 
That I left unspoken
What hurts the most
Is being so close
And havin' so much to say 
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowin'
What could've been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do, oh
Oh, yeah
Woo
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say 
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowin'
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do
Not seeing that loving you
That’s what I was trying to do

27,"""How to Save a Life""",The Fray,https://genius.com/The-fray-how-to-save-a-life-lyrics,"Step one, you say, ""We need to talk""
He walks, you say, ""Sit down, it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
Pray to God He hears you
And pray to God He hears you, and
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
How to save a life
How to save a life
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend 
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night 
Had I known how to save a life
How to save a life
How to save a life"

But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul 'cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in because I'm gone again
And to him, I just can't be true
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
I feel it in the air as I'm doin' my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek as he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well
'
Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy

I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this anymore
Woah, anymore
And I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
And every time I walk out the door

Every time I do, it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?
And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out
And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times
I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Remember the old arcade?
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down
We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel
Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it
If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Look at this photograph

Every time I do, it makes me"

Ooh
I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
(
I watched you die, in your sleep
)
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
(
I was too young for you to lean on me
)
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
(
You never saw me, yeah, yeah
)
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty

Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
She said, ""Some days, I feel like shit
Some days, I wanna quit and just be normal for a bit""
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along, but the trips always feel so long
And I find myself tryin' to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot working my day around a call
But when I pick up, I don't have much to say
So I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing, ""Where'd you go?""
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home
Come back home, you know, the place where you used to live
Used to barbeque up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Halloween with candy by the pile
But, now, you only stop by every once in a while
Shit, I find myself just filling my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doing fine and I'm planning to keep it that way
And you can call me if you find that you have something to say
And I'll tell you I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing, ""Where'd you go?""
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home
I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, no longer debating
Tired of sitting and hating and making these excuses
For why you're not around and feeling so useless
It seems one thing has been true all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back, I won't be here and you can sing it
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone

Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home

Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
My baby 
 boy
Just let it die with no goodbyes
Details don't matter, we both paid the price
Tears in my eyes
You know sometimes it'd be like that, baby
 Now every time I see you, I pretend I'm fine
When I wanna reach out to you
But I turn and I walk and I let it ride
Baby, I must confess
We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best
And don't forget about
 Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us
Oh, they say that you're in a new relationship
But we both know nothing comes close to
What we had, it perseveres
That we both can't forget it
How good we used to get it
There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine 
No matter who you go through
We are one, that's a fact that you can't deny
So, baby, we just can't let the fire pass us by

Well, my heart knows me better than I know myself
So I'm gonna let it do all the talking
I came across a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree
I felt a little fear upon my back
I said, ""Don't look back, just keep on walking""
Well, the big black horse said, ""Look this way""
He said, ""Hey lil' lady, will you marry me?""
But I said, ""No no, no no no no""
I said, ""No no""
You're not the one for me""
No no, no no no no
I said, ""No no, you're not the one for me
Ooh, woohoo
And my heart had a problem in the early hours
So I stopped it dead for a beat or two
But I cut some cord and I shouldn't have done it
And it won't forgive me after all these years
So I sent her to a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree
Now it won't come back cause it's oh so happy
And now I've got a hole for the world to see, yeah
And it said, ""No no, no no no no
I said, ""No no
You're not the one for me""
No no, no no no no
I said, ""No no, you're not the one for me""
Ooh, woohoo
I said, ""No no no no, no no no
No, no
You're not the one for me"" 
No no no no
No no
No no, you're not the one for me""
Big black horse and a cherry tree
I can't quite get there
'Cause my heart's forsaken me
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Big black horse and a cherry tree 
I can't quite get there cause my heart's forsaken me"

Tonight we gettin' unpredictable
So try to roll with

C ain't after A and B when you're with me
It don't make sense right now but it will
Later on when you see how I make you feel
Regular ain't in my vocabulary
When it comes to love makin', neither is missionary
Positions: girl pick one, better yet some
Never mind that, we tryin' all of 'em!

Up in your lifestyle

Some say that sex is overrated, but they just ain't doin' it right
I keeps it interesting baby just take them clothes off
I'll be your Tylenol just take me till you doze off
Wake you up in the middle of the night and take you to another world
You'll wake up in the mornin' feelin' like another girl

But there's just one thing I need from you

I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand

'Cause you ain't been seen with a man so fly

Damn girl, don't hurt 'em
If niggas don't back that, you gon work 'em
Put your mack down, I know your background
What you want, girl? You gettin' that now
That's how you do it, huh? Well, I'm the coolest one
Them badbitches in the back, bring 'em to the front
Bitch! Tell that man you's a boss bitch
Make some noise, raise your hand if you's a boss bitch
I don't think he understands you's a boss bitch
Get some help if you can, 'cause he lost it
Ain't no refunds—she spent the cash, man
In your Benz with her friends in the fast lane, flossin'
He said, ""How much it cost me?""
About a million dollars, player—she's bossy
I'm bossy, I'm the first girl to scream on a track
I switched up the beat of the drum
That's right, I brought all the boys to the yard
And that's right, I'm the one that's tattooed on his arm
I'm bossy, I'm the bitch y'all love to hate
I'm the chick that's raised the stake
I told Young Stunna he should switch to BAPE
I'm back with an 808 'cause I'm bossy
Uh, uh, watch that thing go

Hop out the ride and let the dime smoke off the range
Just by the chain, you can tell the big kid do his thang
I'm off the chain
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm hot, kid
Chain so low, you would think the diamonds never stopped it
And it's funny 'cause you could never stop it
A bunch of rocks on my hand and I ain't even on the block, kid
Show 'em white gold, sorta hold it like my Timbs
And the chain hang twenty-four inches like the rims
Diamonds all blown up , sorta like a pimp
So when the light hit the ice, it starts glistenin' off the tip 
My chain hang, all it do is bling-bling
Half blue, half red, like my diamonds gang-bang
And I don't even think we on the same thang
Charm so heavy, they couldn't lift it 'til the crane came

Could she be that lady?
Ayy

Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?
Look back and watch me
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh
Upfront style, ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the 'Lac down
Konvict's got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club, the wardrobe intact now
I feel it, dawnin' cracked now
Ooh, I see it dull and backed now
I'ma call her, then I put the mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now
I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?

Oh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thang on
Get a little drink on, they gon' flip
For this Akon shit, you can bank on it
Pedicure, manicure, kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin' like one of them Putty-Cat Dolls
Tryin' to hold my woodie back through my drawers
Steps off stage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me, and she's like ""You're—""
I'm like, 
""I know, let's cut to the chase
No time to waste, back to my place""
Plus from the club to the crib's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus, I got a pal if your gal is game
In fact, he's the one singin' the song that's playin' 
I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over? 
Look back and watch me

Eminem's rollin', D and 'em rollin'
Bu and all marvelous, them rollin'
Women just ho-in', big booty rollin'
Soon, I'll be all in them and throwin' D
Hittin' no less than three
Block wheel style like, ""Whee!""
Girl, I can tell you want me, 'cause lately
I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?

You know, I be thinkin' to myself
We had a lot of good times together 
We did everything together
Yeah, we would wake up early in the mornin' 
And just get in the car and just ride on out 
Remember that? 
Used to watch the sunrise 
Used to watch the sunset 
We was everything to each other, you know? 
 Damn, I miss those days
If I could just, if I could just hold you in my arms, you know what I mean? 
It just feels so good 
If I could just have one wish
Damn, baby
Just don't understand where we went wrong
I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave you—
As a matter of fact, I was the one who said I loved you first
It was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
We were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
'Cause we couldn't be alone
See, your mama knew I was somethin' else, she knew how I felt
Back then, we were in school and that's your favorite excuse
Growin' up, I was a fool and I can't lie, I'm missin' you
Listen and don't trip
I think I need a bottle with a genie in it
Here's my wish list
First one, I would create a heart-changin' love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes
'Cause I'll be okay if I get one
If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me, I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Makin' love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
Now, tell me, is this the only way I can get you right back in?
If so, then searchin' I'll go, then I can have you for sho
Then you'll be lovin' me, holdin' me, kissin' me
So girl, don't tell me what I'm feelin' is make-believe
I swear, if I lose a second chance with you
I wouldn't know what to do
I'll probably check myself into some kind of clinic
I couldn't be alone because without you, I'm sick
Here's my wish list
First one, I would create a heart-changin' love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes
'Cause I'll be okay if I get one
If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
 
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you , trust me, I'll trust you 
If I had one wish, we would run away 
Makin' love all day , have us a baby 
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life 
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish
I don't even know how we ended up on this road
And, even though we are grown, girl, I just want you to know
If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
 
If I had one wish, you would be my boo 
Promise to love you , trust me, I'll trust you 
If I had one wish , we would run away 
Makin' love all day , have us a baby 
If I had one wish , I'd make you my whole life 
And you'll be my wife , make it right this time

A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

You two from the closet
Wishing to be the friction in your jeans
Isn't it messed up how I'm just dyin' to be him?

Savin' dimes, spendin' too much time on the telephone

Lot of my bitches be comin' from miles around
See they be comin' cause they know how the God get down
Now you know who holdin' the throne so gimme the crown
Niggas salutin' and tryna give me a pound
 I don't really fuck with you niggas, you niggas is clowns
Making the bitches strippin', throw they shit on the ground
 Now that's the way that it goes 
When we up in the spot the shit be flooded with hoes 
See we a make it hot, the chicks will come out their clothes
That's when you get it, mami already know I suppose
Shorty wildin' and Shorty open, she beastin' it out
For the record, just a second I'm freaking it out

When I come I be doin' it and doin' it well 
Then I beat up the coochie and be makin' it swell
Tryna hide the smell of the sex, spraying on the Chanel
Then they try to walk with a strut so no one could tell
 How a nigga got in they butt, made everything jail
 Now the chick will wild like a nut, she blowin' my cell
 Can't get enough of the kid, I put her under my spell
 It's crowded, mami, move it along 
If you know you 'bout it then get to removin' your thong 
To the whip and back of the truck that's where you belong
After the yac, see the type of raunchy shit they be on
Street niggas respect it because my movement is strong
 'Cause we consistently rep and see my money is long
All my bitches is wit' me, see how they singing the song
Plus how we give 'em the stick and we be dickin' along

I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass hi-hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B (
Boy, you hurtin' that

Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me with them curtains back
Me and B, she about to sting, stand back
Baby, seem like everywhere I go, I see you
From your eyes, I smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly, I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you 
Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control

Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
Feels like I'm losin' it

Blow wind, so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever? That's the argu-a-ment
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits like a factory
I'm just one to one, nuttin' after me
No déjà vu, just me and my

Without thinking that you're there 
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having déjà vu

When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today, yeah

Well, I wanna drive it all night long

This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down, I'm back up again
You're in my blood, I'm not a lonely man
There's no load I can't hold
A road so rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in

A misunderstanding once

Ourselves, and I'm sick of the lie
And you're too late

You want me, come find me
Make up your mind
Couldn't take the blame, sick with shame
Must be exhausting to lose your own game
Selfishly hated, no wonder you're jaded
You can't play the victim this time
And you're too late
So don't cry to me, if you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me, come find me
Make up your mind
You never call me when you're sober
You only want it 'cause it's over

Have burned paradise?
How could I

On a snow-white Christmas Eve
Goin' home to see her mama and her daddy
With the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was runnin' low
On faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was goin' way too fast
Before she knew it
She was spinnin' on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel
It was still gettin' colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
Sleepin' like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, ""I'm sorry for the way
I've been livin' my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight""
""Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance

I just wanted to make sure you were really okay
And wanted to see if you were checking in on your medication
You know I love you, and...
Take care, honey
I know you're under a lot of pressure
See ya. Bye bye”)
I have to block out thoughts of you so I don’t lose my head
They crawl in like a cockroach, leaving babies in my bed
Dropping little reels of tape to remind me that I’m alone
Playing movies in my head that make a porno feel like home
There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain
An ounce of peace is all I want for you; will you never call again?
And will you never say that you loved me just to put it in my face?
And will you never try to reach me?
It is I that wanted space
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you
I’m sober now for 3 whole months
It’s one accomplishment that you helped me with
The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing I won’t touch again
In a sick way, I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night
While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight
You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicide and hate
You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take
So I’ll drive so fucking far away that I never cross your mind
And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you
And with a sad heart, I say bye to you and wave
Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I had made
And like a baby boy, I never was a man
Until I saw your blue eyes cry and I held your face in my hand
And then I fell down yelling, “Make it go away!”
Just make her smile come back and shine just like it used to be
And then she whispered “How can you do this to me?”
Hate me today

This clock never seemed so alive
I can't keep up and I can't back down
I've been losing so much time
'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to lose
And it's you and me and all other people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you
All of the things that I want to say just aren't coming out right
I'm tripping on words
You've got my head spinning
I don't know where to go from here
'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to prove
And it's you and me and all other people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you
There's something about you now
I can't quite figure out
Everything she does is beautiful
Everything she does is right
'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to lose
And it's you and me and all other people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you

And if he make one, hell naw they dont psych me
I'm all about my cash, ridin' around wit a nice piece
Ear piece, ice piece, they straight like me
You heard pimping player 
Don't stand so close vision blurs when ice blings
Respect my whole squad, no, you can't even touch us, cuz
Role out the red carpet, high 5 and show us love
Carry barrettas, count cheddar, we trendsetters
I'm a Franchize nigga, half a mil' or betta
Check it out, 
Six 0, six four four
, six nine four
Blow 'dro with the windows up on deuce four's
Purple candy paint, brand new, think I ain't
Same chick, same clique, more bricks in the bank
Know now, no ho round, throw down like Brat
It ain't no showdown for no crown, I'm holding that 
They saw me on VH, pay great till this day
Been in love with the mic since Run-D.M.C. walked this way
I talk this way cause I'm gangsta a chi-town legend
I'm not ordinary people it's a star in your presence
I'm so icy that my earlobes hurt for what its worth
Don't test me I got the four fifth under the skirt
Thick in the thighs can't touch that
Stay on my grind, I bust back if I must act and empty a stack
Its B to the R-A-T trust that I'm crazy, 
JD pays me,
 I'm such a fucking lady
I'm Bow Weezy, prince of the O-town
Just got the wheels clean, so I'm riding slow now
I'm in a fast car, something like a NASCAR
If you wanna know how much it cost you should ask pa
As far as the watch and chain
I dropped some change, its easy for me to cop them things
And I don't stop, I got rocks and rings, you know
The same size as a boxing ring
Swimming pool in the front and the back yard
I ain't gotta act hard, I'm under 21 with a black card
And yea I know that was kind of a low blow
But the dough for the So So don't come slow
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I think they like me, oh, I think they like me

Saying that I love you

You'll understand when I finish, yeah

But I don't wanna be the one to tell you a lie so

And everything I tried to remember to say just went out my head
So I'ma do the best I can to get you to understand 'cause I know
There's never a right time to say goodbye

One, two, three
Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing and
There's no way we ever could
Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it
So we keep waiting 
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting 
Waiting on the world to change
It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting 
Waiting on the world to change
Now if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
'Cause when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want
That's why we're waiting 
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting 
Waiting on the world to change
It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting 
Waiting on the world to change
And we're still waiting 
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting 
Waiting on the world to change
One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population
So we keep on waiting 
Waiting on the world to change
Now we keep on waiting 
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting

Toke another pound, got a head high
Never get caught, never get fined
Livin' on the low, call me Loki
Brother like Thor, Waititi
She never loved me like Kiki
Make sure she don't forget how she did me
Verse 1
Never make a scene, this ain't a movie
You may be living large, but your rep is amusing
Surrounded by the people who you think are your posse
Just to realise that they fake and they flaunting
Bounce out this joint to the next one
Keep it going hard in the moment
If it makes sense, it's an omen
All white drip to the church in the morning
Pray to the Lord we get it right this time
Another chance at life, we don't get rewinds
Take a step back if you want to find
Another outlook to the past behind
Lookin' so good now, only hear the whispers
Did he have something done ov'r the past weekend?
This here's all natural, nothing is fake
You can't relate 'cause the hate's all you make

Verse 2
I am on another level
My feet firmly on the ground though
Wake up early every morning
To live the life my dreams are
Out of all this commotion we gon' be better off on our own
Just 'cause this world was built to be owned or to be slaved off
Grab the whips from the guards
How the tables have turned for the opps
Cause the dealer and his cards
Have cheated their way just by being at large
Masks off, Rey Mysterio
Pump it louder, on the stereo
Black eyed peas, find the peace, cause hysteria
At this point, we ain't close and it's critical
Clever with the bars, call me nifty
Racking up the hits, get shwifty
I'm halfway gone to be fifty
But bitches find me smooth with the bread like jiffy
Peanut butter on the toast, and that's the tea
Next time I spit a fire verse, I ask for fees
I own everything I say, apostrophe
A killer on the loose, call me Ted Bundy

Hey, Hailie

In my own words, I guess
Have you ever loved someone so much you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
""Daddy, look what I made!"" ""Dad's gotta go catch a plane""
""Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?""
""I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, the song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself""
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spittin' image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby, ha
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
""You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?""
""Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more"" ""Daddy, you're lyin'
You always say that, you always say, 'This is the last time'
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine""
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it
""Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it wit' ya""
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin' 'cause, man, I can hear 'em
They're sayin', ""You got one more chance to do right, and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late""
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on, and I'm singin'

The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow and ""Thank you all for comin' out""
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
""Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!""
""But, baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?""
""I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'""
""But, baby, wait!"" ""It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name,
 
it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill,
 
yeah, I bet you, you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real""
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, ""Die, Shady!"", and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes
The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringing, there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

We gotta stay...

They call me the Juice, and you know I'ma stunt
Riding in the car with some bump in the trunk
Tone in my lap and you know it's a pump
Breaking down the good green, rolling the blunt
Ghetto pimp type, girls say I'm the man
Ice on the wrist with the ice in the chain
Riding through the hood, got me gripping the grain
And I'm sipping the same while I'm changing the lane
Eyes real tight, 'cause I'm choking the green
Vision messed up, 'cause I'm 
drinking the lean
Messing with a D-boy, riding them big toys
Make your main gal wanna get on my team
She gotta give it up 'fore she get in my car
I ain't Denzel, but I know I'm a star
'Cause when I'm in the club, I be back in the fog 
In the V.I.P. part and be buying the bar 
DJ Paul is a dog, one you do not trust
You leave your green around me, nigga, yo' green gon' get lit up
You leave your drank around me, believe yo' drank gon' get drunk up
You leave your girl around me, if she bad, she gonna get stuck
These niggas is spies
We live them lives and keep them eyes tight
Riding 'round what they like
Make a couple nuns a couple of dykes
So purple, purple, purple, and swallow it down
With the yurple, yurple, yurple, it's going down
I gotta stay high-igh-igh-igh, igh-igh, igh-igh, igh
'Til I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie
I gotta stay high-igh-igh-igh, igh-igh, igh-igh, igh
'Til I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie
Puff, puff, pass, nigga, roll that blunt
Let's get high, nigga, smoke us one 
Paul pulled out the Phantom, niggas can't stand it
But them hoes gon' come 
I just really wanna smoke my weed
Fuck these hoes and stack my G's 
Stop at the light and pause on Three
Hit the mall and it be all on me, but 
Gotta keep one eye up on the po-po
Close the window when I roll the indo 
Know they mad 'cause I'm rolling Benzo
This that purple, not pretendo 
Three 6 Mafia, them my kinfolks
So when I'm in Memphis, Ten-a-key
I just might not bring my own
'Cause them niggas there let me smoke for free
What's up, Mary? How you doing?
Mary Jane stalking me
Since I have met you, girl, you're on my brain 
You stole my heart 
Right from the start 
So I broke you down
Look, momma, put you in the 'gar 
I gotta stay high-igh-igh-igh, igh-igh, igh-igh, igh

Premro full of that dro
Leave the club, full of Rosé Mo
Your girlfriend wanna ride with me
In a car with a pimp, where she supposed to be
You ain't met no dude spit it cold as me
The bag of kush, it cost 650
Have a nigga who smoke Reggie Miller
Coughing and choking constantly
Taste like fruit when you hit it
Gotta have bread to get it
Smoke all night, sleep all day
That's to me the American way
Roll that shit, light that shit
Hit that shit, hold that shit
Blow that shit out slow
Then pass it to me, bro
MJ finna sprinkle in some of that
Super incredible, have a nigga runnin' back
Where the nigga with the good sticky number at?
Cut open a cigarillo like a lumberjack
In the morning, what I need is to
Breathe again, a whole lot of weed
But I'm needing somebody to give me what I need
When I want nothing less than the best of the trees
DJ Paul and Juicy J, 8Ball & MJG
And Young Buck, we don't give a fuck, we must represent this Tennessee
We drink a whole lot of Hennessy, you know a nigga got a lil' hair on his chest
Do me like Bill Clinton girl, take it out your mouth, we'll shoot it right there on your dress
I gotta stay high-igh-igh-igh, igh-igh, igh-igh, igh"

Could it be the little wrinkle over your nose

And sex you all over the place
Could it be the lil' way you storm around
That makes me wanna tear you down
Baby, I ain't sure
But one thing that I do know is
Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
Baby when you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you
And when we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you
Baby, I don't know why it's like that
But you're just so damn sexy
When you're mad
Baby, don't think I don't take you seriously
But I just can't help the fact
That your attitude excites me
And you know ain't nothing better

Mad together and have angry sex
Then we forget what we were mad about

Hey, shorty, why you gotta act like that?
I'm sayin', I'm just tryin' to be nice to you
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye
Can't help but notice how you glowing, I can see in yo' face
Now, I just wonder if he know he close to being replaced
Swear I treat you like a queen you put me in his place
So you can give back his ring and the key to his place
Tell the nigga one thing, that you need your space
Selling niggas one thing, you don't need to chase
I wanna kiss you everywhere between your knees and waist
Hear the sounds that you make and get your knees to shake
Holla at me in the A, you feel you need to escape
I got a mansion and a gate, you with me and you safe
A Benz, a Phantom and a truck with 23's the case
600 G's in the safe, how much cheese it take?
This a chance you need to take, ain't no need to wait
Say the word, we can leave today, this song's special
And it feel like fate, hate to make a mistake
How the same thing making you sad making you stay?
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?

Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye
Can he touch it like that, and make it feel like this?
How I left and came back and it's still like this?
Do he hit it from the back and make you feel it in your chest?
Take advantage of what you're concealing in your dress?
What, he think he too fresh to show that you the best?
Compliment you on your intellect and treat you with respect?
Give you sex 'til you sweat, tongue kissing on your neck?
It's been awhile since she got it like this, I bet
I can tell you ain't just another bitch I met
Ain't nobody got me open like this, not yet
You confused, ain't decided which way you should go yet
So how you keep saying no with your panties so wet?
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack

Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye
Ay, this nigga playing mind games, man
I think the time came that your mind changed, you understand?
Life is like a chess move
You need to make your next move your best move
Keep it pimpin', you understand? Hey
I mean, you know what I'm saying
I done showed you how I feel, you know what I'm saying
I put myself all the way out there, you know
The ball in your court, man
But I just got a question for you: Is you happy?
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack

You were the one

And I believe
It's only just beginning
This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
But do I make you proud?
I guess I've learned
To question is to grow
That you still have faith
Is all I need to know
I've learned to love
Myself in spite of me
And I've learned to
Walk on the road that I believe
This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
But do I make you proud?
Everybody needs to rise up
Everybody needs to be loved
To be loved
This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you, do I make you proud
This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now 
Never been afraid of standing out 
But do I make you proud?
This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
Do I make you proud?
But do I make you proud?
This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you, do I make you proud"
100,"""For You I Will (Confidence)""",Teddy Geiger,https://genius.com/Teddy-geiger-for-you-i-will-confidence-lyrics,"Alright, yeah
I'm wandering the streets in a world underneath it all
Nothing seems to be
Nothing tastes as sweet as what I can't have
Like you and the way that you're twisting your hair 'round your finger
Tonight I'm not afraid to tell you
What I feel about you
Oh, I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
And cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
Forgive me if I st-stutter from all of the clutter in my head
Cause I could fall asleep in those eyes
Like a water-bed
Do I seem familiar? I've crossed you in hallways a thousand times
No more camouflage, I wanna be exposed
And not be afraid to fall
Oh, I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
And cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
Always want what you can't have
But I've got to try
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
For you I will
For you I will
For you
If I could dim the lights in the mall and create a moon
Yeah, I would
And shout out your name so it echoes in every room, yeah
That's what I'd do
That's what I'd do
To get through to you, yeah
Oh, I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
And cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
You always want what you can't have
But I've got to try
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
For you I will
For you I will
For you I will"
