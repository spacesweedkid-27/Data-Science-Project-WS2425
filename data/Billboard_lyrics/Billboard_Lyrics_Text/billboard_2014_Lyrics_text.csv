Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
Here come bad news, talking this and that 
Well, give me all you got, don't hold it back 
Well, I should probably warn ya, I'll be just fine 
No offense to you, don’t waste your time, here's why

Katy Perry, Juicy J
Uh-huh, let's rage
I knew you were, you were gonna come to me
And here you are, but you better choose carefully
'Cause I, I'm capable of anything
Of anything, and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy 
Your enemy , your enemy
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm comin' at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no goin' back
Mark my words, this love will make you levitate
Like a bird, like a bird without a cage
We're down to earth if you choose to walk away
Don't walk away 
It's in the palm of your hand now, baby
It's a yes or a no, no maybe
So just be sure before you give it all to me
All to me, give it all to me
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm comin' at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no goin' back
She's a beast, I call her Karma 
She eat your heart out like Jeffrey Dahmer 
Be careful, try not to lead her on
Shawty heart is on steroids 'cause her love is so strong
You may fall in love when you meet her 
If you get the chance, you better keep her 
She's sweet as pie, but if you break her heart
She turn cold as a freezer 
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my sleepin' beauty, I'm gon' put her in a coma 
Damn, I think I love her, shawty so bad, I'm sprung and I don't care
She ride me like a roller coaster, turn the bedroom into a fair 
Her love is like a drug, I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil' mama so dope, I messed around and got addicted
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for 
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm comin' at you like a dark horse 
Are you ready for, ready for 
A perfect storm, perfect storm? 
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine 
There's no goin' back"

Drawing me in and you kicking me out
You've got my head spinning, no kidding
I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright
My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh
How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful, too
The world is beating you down, I'm around
Through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing
In my head for you
My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you

Risking it all, though it's hard

Drop this and let the whole world feel it 
And I'm still in the Murda Bizness
I can hold you down, like I'm giving lessons in physics 
You should want a bad bitch like this 
Drop it low and pick it up just like this 
Cup of Ace, cup of Goose, cup of Cris
High heels, something worth a half a ticket on my wrist 
Taking all the liquor straight, never chase that 
Rooftop like we bringing '88 back 
Bring the hooks in, where the bass at?
Champagne spilling, you should taste that
I'm so fancy, you already know
I'm in the fast lane, from L.A. to Tokyo
I'm so fancy, can't you taste this gold?
Remember my name, 'bout to blow-oh-oh-oh
I said baby, I do this, I thought that you knew this
Can't stand no haters, and honest, the truth is
That my flow retarded, each beat dear, departed
Swagger on stupid, I can't shop in no department
And get my money on time, if it ain't 'bout money, decline
And swear I meant that there so much that I give that line a rewind
Said I get my money on time, if it ain't 'bout money, decline
I just can't worry 'bout no haters, gotta stay on my grind
Now tell me, who that, who that? That do that, do that?
Put that paper over all, I thought you knew that, knew that
I be that I-G-G-Y, put my name in bold
I been working, I'm up in here with some change to throw
I'm so fancy, you already know
I'm in the fast lane, from L.A. to Tokyo
I'm so fancy, can't you taste this gold?
Remember my name, 'bout to blow-oh-oh-oh
Trash the hotel
Let's get drunk on the minibar
Make the phone call
Feels so good getting what I want
Yeah, keep on turning it up
Chandelier swinging, we don't give a fuck
Film star, yeah, I'm deluxe
Classic, expensive, you don't get to touch, ow!
Still stunting, how you love that?
Got the whole world asking how I does that 
Hot girl, hands off, don't touch that 
Look at it, I bet you wishing you could clutch that
That's just the way you like it, huh?
It's so good, he just wishing he could bite it, huh? 
Never turn down nothing
Slayin' these hoes, gold trigger on the gun like
I'm so fancy, you already know
I'm in the fast lane, from L.A. to Tokyo
I'm so fancy, can't you taste this gold?

I was left to my own devices
Many days fell away with nothing to show
And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love
Grey clouds roll over the hills, bringing darkness from above
But if you close your eyes , does it almost feel like nothing changed at all? 
And if you close your eyes , does it almost feel like you've been here before? 
How am I gonna be an optimist about this? 
How am I gonna be an optimist about this? 
We were caught up and lost in all of our vices
In your pose as the dust settled around us
And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love
Grey clouds roll over the hills, bringing darkness from above
But if you close your eyes , does it almost feel like nothing changed at all? 
And if you close your eyes , does it almost feel like you've been here before?

And you think I'm crazy
Yeah, you think I'm crazy
I wanted the fame but not the cover of 
Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see,
 
but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Woo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep

Yonder and stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen

And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head,

Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can't get to me at all
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free
Let it go, let it go
I'm one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand
And here I'll stay
Let the storm rage on
My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never goin' back, the past is in the past
Let it go, let it go

This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nothin' to something, liking to lovin'
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking?
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feelin' stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothin' for us, ain't no place in between
Might, might be me believin' what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever, but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singin' this song
You were different from my last, but now you got 'em mirrored
And as it all plays out, I see it couldn't be clearer, now sing

When I was at my worst, down on my knees

Talkin' 'bout you be reppin' that Third, I wanna see all the shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side, ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight
Catch a charge, I might
Beat the box up like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no, I don't play

Your breasteses is my breakfast, we goin' in

Bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keepin' me stylish
Now that's real, real, real

So get a grip, take a sip of that feel right

, 
flat bills flipped back
Yeah, you can find us where the party's at
This is how we roll
We hangin' 'round, singin' out everything on the radio
We light it up 
with our hands up
This is how we roll, 
this is how we do
We burnin' down the night, shootin' bullets at the moon
Baby, this is how we roll
Yeah, baby, this is how we roll, we rollin' into town
With nothin' else to do, we take another lap around
Yeah, holla at your boy if you need a ride
If you roll with me, yeah, you know we rollin' high
Up on them 37 Nittos, windows tinted, hard to see though
How fresh my baby is in the shotgun seat, oh
Them kisses are for me though, automatic like a free throw
This life I live, it might not be for you, but it's for me though, let's roll

She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her, ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's stayin' at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missin' it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissin' him, how I was confused about
Now, she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was cryin' on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next 
(
Get lost
)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
 
(
Get lost
)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were stayin' on the same **** hotel floor
And I wasn't lookin' for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singin'
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love

Yardie shubeen just started, real long minute, you're in it for a finish, innit?
Baddie not Wraylee's family, not just nephews, ain't no limits, innit?
Ain't come thru' for the passa, Rasta please no gaze, no gimmicks, innit?
Call the five-ding door spinners becah we fidget before we spin it, spin it
What?
Spin it, fill it, whip it, tug it, rise up, fly that bullet, bullet
Man's in the shubeen with two drinks mixin', tell the DJ, ""Ayy, pull it"" 
Seen so many man get jerked in the night times cookin', the heat's like spice, man bun him
Bro's in the trap shottin' white girl, now he's in a white cells, funny how a whitе man's judgin'
Why-why they judgin' like Judge Rindеr?
Everybody wan' pree, man, it's comin' like it's made of inter
And my brudda hit her with a switcher
No Ninja Turtle, get left, no likkle Splinter
Know what, my killy from Brum, a big gyal to some, but to him, I'm a likkle sister
This-this baddie lookin' for a mister, it's tough, I put my fist up, hit her with a twister 
Bar-barbie, don't need bare ice, no lolli' for bare badeens in oh polly, gosh golly
[Verse 3: Tana & 
Cristale

I-I twist it Ollie if she's got body-ollie, pon tings, I get froggy, I'm sorry
A hot boy, Bobby Shmurda, bodied, I fist up my man like me squared on hockey 
I see him get lift, stairs are rocky
Gunners out, so we put the work on rugby
Gu-Gunners out like it was AFTV, GG, jump out, spin it like CD's
Put it on loop, repeat, cheeky, just got hat off a beanie 
Ju-just got hat off the baddest, she give me the baddest
Simmer toes curl so freely
Champagnepapi, they love me like Kiki
That's why they wan' watch and pree me (

Own-own in the corner, Wray with the slush pup
Two yutes hit the grey goose, no duck, duck 
Brow-brow-brown and white, made the lightweight upchuck
Badman arch up, they do get gun buck
They-they do get gun buck or buck fiddy
My young bucks buck or bun cod for me
Kucheans, I'm a unit as Kompany
Get jacks on curtesy's fuckery
Get-get Jackson on Janet and Tan' still spazzin'

Caucasian females came in for black yutes
Pocket them, hungry for money like fat yutes
Try do up this yute, get done up like that yute
Do-do-done up by that yute, stick it like bamboos
Niggas take things without thank you

I've been sat with you for most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here, we wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know if you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close, take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady
I need you, darling, come on, set the tone

And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we've got nothin' to say and nothin' to know
But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' ""We Found Love"" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and then just hope and pray
I told her my name and said, ""It's nice to meet ya""
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know she's a keeper just from this one small act of kindness
I'm in deep **** if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I've drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now, she's kissin' my mouth
I need you, darling, come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin', won't you let me know?

If you love me, come on, get involved

Before the beat kicks in again?
Can you feel it?
Ooh-ah-pa
Can you feel it?

Thinkin', ""no way, she ain't got one""
Soon as I sat down, I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off
She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""Come here, boy, I wanna dance""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
I'da gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool; AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up

We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is""

You should have seen her smile when I broke out my guitar
She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""Come here boy, I wanna dance""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights, she gave me a goodnight kiss
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
Yeah, play it again, play it again, play it again

You get your hands in it
Plant your roots in it

You write her name on it
Spin your tires on it
Build your corn field, whiskey, bonfires on it 
You bet your life on it, yeah
It's that...
Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt
Rosie and I had five children, one died at birth, they were tough times, tough years, did okay
You've mixed some sweat with it
Taking a shovel to it
You've stuck some crosses and some painted
Goal posts through it 
You know you came from it 
And some day you'll return to...
Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on

And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt
I asked Rosie one time if she wanted to travel to see the world, and no she said ""the world comes right to my window every day""... Even if it's broken

Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt
See Rosie was right about two things: you don't have to see the world to be worldly, just raise good children, bake good enough pies and the world will come right to your kitchen window. She's right about something else too, I built that baseball diamond way too close to the kitchen

Nothing's gonna hurt you the way that words do

Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins
But I wonder what would happen if you
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave

Everybody's been stared down by the enemy
Fallen for the fear
And done some disappearing, bow down to the mighty
Don't run, stop holding your tongue
Maybe there’s a way out of the cage where you live
Maybe one of these days, you can let the light in
And show me, how big your brave is
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
And since your history of silence
Won't do you any good
Did you think it would?
Let your words be anything but empty
Why don't you tell them the truth?
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out

To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue 'cause you love the taste, yeah

Now all the stars are turnin' blue, just kissed the clock 2:22
Baby, I know what you're wishin' for, I'm wishin' for it too
Now all the lights are flashin' gold, nobody cares how fast we go
Our soundtrack's in the stereo
The DJ's on a roll
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again?
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on
The sun'll steal the magic from us soon
So let's take one more trip around the moon
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally?
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter all around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind 
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on
We can leave the night on
Buzzin' like a streetlight
We can leave 'em on tonight"

I couldn't get my money back so I'm in seat 7A
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I bet the fella on the aisle thought I was crazy
Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays
I'm getting drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737
 
rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
We had this date marked on the calendar forever
We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together
I feel like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the cake
So hey, I'm getting drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737

I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
On my way home I'll bump this seat right up to first class
So I can drink that cheap champagne out of a real glass
And when we land I'll call her up and tell her kiss my ass
Cause hey, I'm drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737

All my girls just keep on blowin' up my phone
Sayin', ""Come on, he ain't worth the pain
Do what you gotta do to forget his name""
Now there's only one thing left for me to do
Slip on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots
Check the mirror one last time
And kiss the past goodbye
What I'm really needin' now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
'Til I don't remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey, bartender, pour 'em hot tonight
'Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it 'til his memory fades away
Hey, bartender
Tonight I'll let a stranger pull me on the floor
Spin me 'round and let him buy a couple more
But before it goes too far
I’'l let him down easy
'Cause tonight it's all about dancin' with my girls to the DJ
Put that song on replay
What I'm really needin' now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
'Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey, bartender, pour 'em hot tonight
'Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it 'til his memory fades away

I'm feelin' that buzz, I'm ready to rock
Ain't no way I'm gonna tell you to stop
So pour that thing up to the top
I'm comin' in hot
Hey, bartender
Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh
What I'm really needin' now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
'Til I don't remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender, pour 'em hot tonight
'Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it 'til his memory fades away

And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all
[Verse 2: Calum, 
Calum & Luke
]
The pictures that you sent me, they're still livin' in my phone
I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around
It hurts to know you're happy, yeah, it hurts that you moved on
It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long
It's like we never happened, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all
I remember the day you told me you were leavin'
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
[Bridge: Luke & Ashton, 
Luke
]
If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never slip away
And you'd never hear me say
[Chorus: All, 
Luke
]
I remember the day you told me you were leavin'
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all
No, I'm really not fine at all
Tell me this is just a dream
'Cause I'm really not fine at all"

I’m the type of nigga split a mil with a bitch
Hold up, only if she bad though
Out here trying to find someone that better than my last ho
Take her to my castle, drown her in my cash flow
Say your dick so little she can fit it in her asshole
Told me she can't ride this shit no further than a cab go
Said I got that dumb dick, she wanna be my tutor
So she give me brain, getting head on the scooter
Had sex on the beach from Bermuda up to Cuba

And only 92 in Daytona
And it's sunshine, blue eyes, tan lines, it's low tide
Rolling white sand, cold can koozie in my hand, just a summertime strollin'
Chillin', breezin', sippin', singin' woah a oh, oh

Whatever happens happens
And there's a reggae band, full of dread heads
Just sittin' in the corner laughin'
Well my baby walks over, drops a 20 in a jar
She smiles and shakes it at me
Yeah, she gets 'em going, she gets 'em playing

Hello, haters, damn y'all mad
30k on the Caddy, now how backpack rap is that?

Lookin' down from heaven like damn that's stylish

Knew I'd have a whip but never one like this

, two-seater
Yeah, I'm from Seattle, there's hella Honda Civics
I couldn't tell you about paint either
But I really wanted a Caddy so I put in the hours

Got the keys in, as I was leavin' I started screamin'

She doing line after line like she's writing rhymes
I had her inhalin' my love, tryna blow her mind
Cadillac pimpin', my uncle was on
14, I stole his keys, me and my niggas was gone
Stealing portions of his liquor, water in his Patron
Drivin', smilin' like I won the fucking lottery homes
Tires with the spokes on it, and the Vogues too
Mustard and mayonnaise,
 keepin' the buns all on
My dogs hangin' out the window
Young as whoosh, fuckin' like we ball
Tryna fuck 'em all
Never park the whip, see what's poppin' at the mall
Meet a bad bitch, slap her booty with my paw
You can smoke the pussy, I was tearin' down the walls
I'm motherfuckin' awe-
-some, swear these sights tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steerin' wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes
Maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Or does she want it low?
'Cause this shit a Coupe de Ville so you'll never know
So we cruise for minutes, 
my nigga fuck the limit
Got a window tinted, for sure a gangsta in it
Slide 'til the gas is finished, Q

Chauffeur eavesdroppin', tryin' not to crash
Oh, there, daddy, daddy, now you rip my fur
Oh, baby, baby be sweatin' off my hair
Took forty-five minutes to get all dressed up

Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe?
Le sexe, je veux dire: l'activité physique, le coït. Tu aimes ça ?
Tu ne t'intéresses pas au sexe ?
Les hommes pensent que les féministes détestent le sexe, mais c'est une activité très stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like
The kind of girl you like
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like
The kind of girl you like is right here with me

We go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bills shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh, Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?
Niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh, Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it;
 
if I ain't the greatest, then I'm headed for it
Yeah, that mean I'm way up 
Yeah, the 6 ain't friendly, but that's where I lay up 
This shit a mothafuckin' lay-up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, Chef Curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Ayy, who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man, we really with the shits, boy
Yeah, really with the shits, 
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy 'cause I got all the hits, boy 
Fuck all that ""Drake, you gotta chill"" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bills shit
Yeah, I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season
 in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker, that's my nigga
Oh, Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean, we could really get it, we could go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it 
I run this shit, they like, ""Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest""
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh, Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't made me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I been ready
Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man, I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

Whole squad on that real shit, yeah
The other night Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough, I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended, but they smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up"

That’s what I always thought
Yeah, I was that kind of man
Just ask anyone
I don’t dance, But here I am
Spinning you round and round in circles
It Ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere
Yes, you got me in the palm of your hand
Cause, I don’t dance
Love’s never come my way
I’ve never been this far
Cause you took these two left feet
And waltzed away with my heart
No, I don’t dance, but here I am
Spinning you round and round in circles
It ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere
Yes, you got me in the palm of your hand, girl
Cause, I don’t dance

Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen
Pulled up to the church but I got so nervous
Had to back it on up, couldn't make it to the service
Grabbed all the cash underneath my mattress
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen
Ran into a girl in a pretty white dress
Rolled down a window
Where you headed to next?
Said I'm heading to the bar with my money out of the mattress
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen
Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen
Drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
Wake up in the morning, don't know what happened
Whoa... somethin' bad
Whoa... somethin' bad
Now me and that girl that I met on the street
We're rollin' down the road, down to New Orleans
Got a full tank of gas and the money out of the mattress
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen
Bout to tear it up down in New Orleans
Just like a real-life Thelma and Louise
If the cops catch up, they're gonna call it kidnapping
Got a real good feelin' somethin' bad about to happen
Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen
Drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
Wake up in the morning, don't know what happened
Whoa... somethin' bad
Whoa... somethin' bad
Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen
Drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
Wake up in the morning, don't know what happened
