I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm goin' through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty 
No one's around to judge me 
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh
The city's cold and empty 
No one's around to judge me 
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
I'm just calling back to let you know 
I could never say it on the phone 
Will never let you go this time 
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch"

Oh,  oh, oh
Oh,  oh, oh, oh, oh
We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
I  couldn't be there even when I tried
You  don't believe it, we do this every time
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed  the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm  waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away
Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex, though, the sex, though
And I still hear the echoes 
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away
Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
It's only me, what you got to lose?
Make up your mind, tell me, what are you gonna do?
It's only me, let it go
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away"
3,"""The Box""",Roddy Ricch,https://genius.com/Roddy-ricch-the-box-lyrics,"Pullin' out the coupe at the lot
Told 'em fuck 12, fuck SWAT
Bustin' all the bells out the box
I just hit a lick with the box
Had to put the stick in the box, mmh
Pour up the whole damn seal, I'ma get lazy
I got the mojo deals, we been trappin' like the '80s
She sucked a nigga soul, gotta Cash App
Told 'em wipe a nigga nose, say slatt, slatt
I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that
And I really wanna know where you at, at
I was out back where the stash at
Cruise the city in a bulletproof Cadillac 
'Cause I know these niggas after where the bag at
 
Gotta move smarter, gotta move harder
Nigga try to get me for my water
I'll lay his ass down, on my son, on my daughter
I had the Draco with me, Dwayne Carter
Lotta niggas out here playin', ain't ballin'
I done put my whole arm in the rim, Vince Carter 
And I know probably get a key for the quarter
Shawty barely seen in double C's, I bought 'em
Got a bitch that's looking like Aaliyah, she a model
I got the pink slip, all my whips is key-less
Compton, I'm about to get the key to the city
Patek like the sea, forgive me
Pullin' out the coupe at the lot
Told 'em fuck 12, fuck SWAT
Bustin' all the bells out the box

I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that
And I really wanna know where you at, at, hah
Hahaha, I been movin' 'em out
If Steelo with me, then he got the blues in the pouch 
Took her to the forest, put the wood in her mouth
Bitch, don't wear no shoes in my house
The private I'm flyin' in, I never wan' fly again
I'll take my chances in traffic 
She suckin' on dick, no hands with it
I just made the Rollie plain like a landing strip
I'm a 2020 president candidate
I done put a hundred bands on Zimmerman, shit
I been movin' real gangster, so that's why she picked a Crip
Shawty call me Crisco 'cause I pop my shit
Got it out the mud, there's nothin' you can tell me, yeah
When I had the drugs, I was street wealthy, yeah
Pullin' out the coupe at the lot
Told 'em fuck 12, fuck SWAT
Bustin' all the bells out the box
I just hit a lick with the box
Had to put the stick in the box, mmh
Pour up the whole damn seal, I'ma get lazy

Did a full one-eighty, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now 
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Don't start now

How you pull up? I pull up (Woo, 
SethInTheKitchen

Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop 
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? 
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock 
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me 
You better let me go the day you need me 
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' 
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop
It's safe to say I earned it, ain't a nigga gave me nothin' 
I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
Know you heard me say, ""You play, you lay,"" don't make me push the button
Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama, she hit me on FaceTime just to check up on me and my brother
I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money 
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot 
PTSD, I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu
My daughter a G, she saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two
And I'll kill another nigga too
'Fore I let another nigga do somethin' to you
Long as you know that, don't let nobody tell you different
Daddy love you

Keep a Glocky when I ride in the Suburban
'Cause the codeine had a young nigga swervin'
I got the mop, watch me wash 'em like detergent
And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey
Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote
Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop 
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? 
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock 
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me

Said what I had to and did what I did 
Never turn my back on FBG, God forbid

This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around
For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved"

Like you did on me
I hope what goes comes all the way around
I hope she makes you feel the same way about her
That I feel about you right now
I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
Like you did on me"

Pooh, you a fool for this one
)
Brand new whip, just hopped in 
I got options (
Oh Lord, Jetson made another one
)
I could pass that bitch like Stockton 
Just joshin'
I'ma spend this holiday locked in 
My body got rid of them toxins 
SportsCenter, top ten
I could put the ball in the end zone
Put a bad bitch in the friendzone, ooh
This shit sound like an intro
Jetson, give me that tempo, ooh
Told Pooh he a fool with this shit 
Told her don't let her friends know 
In the 'Ville and I move like a don 
Eating fettuccine at Vincenzo's
Me and my 'migos got that free smoke
On the West Coast, yeah, I'm talking 'bout pre-rolls 
Dark haired bitch and she look like Shego 
Hometown hero, feeling myself, can't murder my ego 
She heard of my deep stroke
She said, ""Babe, does it hurt when I deep throat?"" 
Certified freak ho
Hang around us and she learnin' my lingo
Back then, wasn't worried 'bout me though
In the gym tryna work on my free throw
Goddamn 
Spending money at the club like Sam's 
Yes, ma'am
She a lil' freak on cam 
But she don't put this on the 'Gram 
Lil' boys tryna diss on the 'Gram 
I can't switch on the fam 
Shit's hot, hit the switch on the fan 
This where my head is 
I feel resentment from every direction
Even some homies be wearing expressions
I be discouraged from sharing my blessings 
We used to share a connection
Now it just feels like it's wearing and stretching
I'm getting real sick of taking advice
From people that never could stare at reflections 
Somewhere in there is a lesson
Y'all ain't evolvin', it's very depressing
I'm at the club with the basketball team
Me and the Cardinals are sharing a section 
Gotta cherish the present
I'm drinking water and wearing protection
Got a career and I'm very invested
Some people call it a scary obsession 
I like to call it a passion
I can't be sitting relaxin' 
PG, we getting some traction
I'm at the venue, it's packed in 
I'm digging her accent
I got a B.B. Simon belt on me
And she tryna get it unfastened
That's my type of distraction
That's my type and she Latin 
Got my own flow and I'm 'bout to get a patent
Brand new sheets for the bed, they satin 
Y'all wasn't tuned in back then 
My swag, they keep jackin' 
I ain't doin' no verse, quit askin' 
What's poppin'? (
Pooh, you a fool for this one

Nobody cried 
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care

I got everything I wanted

You with me
And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless

Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all

But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face
When you hurt under the surface

All this designer on my body got me drip, drip, ayy
Straight up out the Yajects, I'm a big Crip
If I got a pint of lean, I'ma sip, sip
I run the racks up with my queen like London and Nip
But I got rich on all these niggas, I didn't forget, back
I had to go through the struggle, I didn't forget that
I hopped inside of the Maybach and now I can sit back
These bitches know me now 'cause I got them big racks
'Cause I'm gettin' money now, I know you heard that
Young nigga on the corner, bitch, I had to serve crack
Uncle fronted me some P's, had to get them birds back
We came up on dirty money, I gave it a birdbath
Cut off the brain and I give my bitch a new coupe

I just found out, the only reason that you lovin' me
Was to get back at your ex-lover, but before you leave
Usually, I would never, would never even care
But, baby, I know you're creepin', I feel it in the air
Every night and every day
I try to make you stay
But your
Savage love
Did somebody, did somebody break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel, but your savage love
When you kiss me, I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that
Your savage love
Your savage lo-lo-love
Your savage lo-lo-love
You could use me
'Cause I still want that (
Your savage love

Baby, I hope that this ain't karma 'cause I get around
You wanna run it up, I wanna lock it down
Usually, don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' fast
You got a way of makin' me spend up all my cash
Every night and every day
I try to make you stay
But your
Savage love
Did somebody, did somebody break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel, but your savage love
When you kiss me, I know you don't give two fucks

Apply my family orders like a pizza man delivery
Jogging l3am kaml even I’m fat, like a machine gun
But 365 never shares or d-d-divided with me
History save!, before I get taped
I don’t wanna drop the key, I wanna be at the end a fairy tail
It’s time to spit what I’m felling on the paper
Shocking content get some sugar or bring some pepper
It took me days to write this with my flavor
I ain't got no wheels, I’m a true pro player like a faker
While I remember the girl that dated she was bhal Tayka
Evil with the makeup, then we break up
Zero percent chances like a naked, the truth rises the silence
The silence kills, Start the funeral, Bury me, invite the undertaker
I’m telling you Whenever, wherever whichever
Whoever I’m already dead inside, however
I just wanna recall the day that I stepped outside
Waddling like duck perhaps at the mid of night
Catching up a taxi Hello sir where you want to go
Please put me in avenue look at me
I called that, I struggle with that cuz I'm lonely
How this verse could be good enough if got somebody

Another day, another day, another day
Should I wait, Should I wait another day, another day
Should I wait another day
Yeah, chilling on my room, eyes up on the roof
Listening to deathbed Powfu
Thinking on a clue for my puzzle to make proof
Life moves leisurely in such a sort of crossword clues
I don’t know why, why this make changes on me
Such randomly, occasionally through my moods
I guess that I’m not the only one with the same groove
Stir the water, the thirsty might show up with the same view
Take or leave it until another day
In any way, you’ll get that we’re all in the same crew
Maybe we’ll make Rendez-Vous in the heaven
For the remission of our sins just say Lahi3fu Or probably Hallelu
Well this, started already get me confused
I really don’t know who I am
I just wanna know who I am
Probably everybody wanna know who I am
Should I wait another day, another day, another day
Another day, another day, another day
Wach ntssana nahr akhor, nhar akhor, nhar akhor, nhar akhor, nhar akhor, nhar akhor
Wach ntssana nahr akhor, nhar akhor, nhar akhor, nhar akhor, nhar akhor, nhar akhor

You coulda had a bad bitch, non-committal
Help you with your career just a little
You're 'posed to hold me down, but you're holding me back
And that's the sound of me not calling you back
Why men great 'til they gotta be great? 
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face

Fresh photos with the bomb lighting 
New man on the Minnesota Vikings 
Truth hurts, needed something more exciting 
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay 
You tried to break my heart?
Oh, that breaks my heart
That you thought you ever had it
No, you ain't from the start
Hey, I'm glad you're back with your bitch
I mean, who would wanna hide this?
I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever be your side chick
I put the sing in single
Ain't worried 'bout a ring on my finger
So you can tell your friend, ""Shoot your shot"" when you see him
It's okay, he already in my DMs

I didn't feel it when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', were you out drinkin'?
Were you in the living room, chillin', watchin' television?
It's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to let you go and let communication die out
I know, you know, we know you weren't
Down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know we weren't
Meant for each other and it's fine
But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight
And there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?
I tried to imagine your reaction
It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', the night we went drinkin'
Stumbled in the house and didn't make it past the kitchen
Ah, it's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out

Would you love me for the hell of it?

If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
Sky'd be falling while I hold you tight
No, there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye

You'd come over, right?
You'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over, right?

And plus I'ma tip 'em, they holdin' my size
Get in your car and just put on your flashers
And follow the hearse since you say you gon' ride
'Cause somebody gon' die if they fuck with us
Turn a five to a dime, that's a double up
Fuck around, walk through church with my double cup
This shit a habit, I'm prayin' I give it up
Tiger stay with the wood, make 'em give it up

Bruh beat the charge, I can get me some sleep
Got a backend to pick up, I won't even leave

And I wanna chase every high with you

You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better, you gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us
I can see in your eye that you fed up
Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
Fuck it, I'm goin' on the front line
He gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line
You know when the storm go away, then the sun shine
You gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time
I want all my sons to grow up to be monsters
I want all my daughters to show out in public
Seems like we losing our country
But we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to
Every video I see on my conscience
I got power, now I gotta say somethin'
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope, but I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope, I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
They trainin' officers to kill us, then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets
They regular people, I know that they feel it
These scars too deep to heal us
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
March for a reason, not just on GP
Our people died for us to be free
Fuck do you mean? This was a dream
Now we got the power that we need to have
They don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life

The way a Marlboro hits me
Some broken in cowboy boots
But I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you, honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love and lovin' on you
I like a sunrise, duck blind
Birdie on a par 5
Miller Lite before noon
I like a two-door old Ford
Wood board back porch
Three chords and the truth
But I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you, honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love with lovin' on you
Girl, I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you, honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love and lovin' on you
I'm in love and lovin' on you"

Huh? 
Ah, I thought a broke nigga said somethin' 
Talkin' shit, but they still ain't sayin' nothin' 
We gon' trap this bitch out 'til the feds come 
Huh? 
Ah, I thought a pussy ho said somethin' 
How it goes, when I'm talkin, you listen 
Cut her off 'cause she spoke on the business 
Hundreds and fifties, can't swap a dime for a penny
You know that's a stupid decision 
Headfirst with it
I shot a shot at my nigga bitch, really didn't think before I did it 
Make it make sense 
Luckily, I was on point with the last ho, kept my receipts 
Warranty good, made sure I got a full refund when I gave her back to the streets 
Forever I rep, put the set on the chain
I'm thuggin', you already know how I came 
Yeah, he got money, but niggas be lame
I Lambo'd her life, told her, ""Get out that Range""
Her mani and pedi same color my teeth 
She got a blue check and a check without me 
Hood nigga ridin' in a foreign on E 
Sick of these niggas, COVID-19 
Karate'd the Wocky, tryna kick the cup  
Came up like Giannis, I get bigger bucks 
Got four different choppers, right there in this truck 
I'm just being honest, I could get you touched 
Put you in the blender, I could get you slushed 
I see the comments but really unbothered
I know it's hurtin', she salty, I scarred her
Beware what you lay up and say to these bitches, they can't hold water 
Ah, I thought a broke nigga said somethin' 
Talkin' shit, but they still ain't sayin' nothin' 
We gon' trap this bitch out 'til the feds come 
Huh? 
Ah, I thought a pussy ho said somethin' 
How it goes, when I'm talkin, you listen 
Cut her off 'cause she spoke on the business 
I thought a nigga who watch what I do
But he can't get his bitch back said somethin' 
Is it true that he postin' another nigga money?
Probably, I don't put that past him 
I thought a ho that be speakin' on me
But be fuckin' a broke nigga said somethin' 
Hol' up, lil' bitch, get a nigga that's lit
I'm the whole loaf, he the breadcrumbs 
Rappers with their mixed feelings 
I ain't fuckin' with 'em 
Like a Richard Mille, let me know what time it is
Bagg, where the Runtz at?  Know you got it on you '
'Posed to be smell-proof, bussin' out the vacuum seal
These niggas lil' boys, childish, Fisher Price
Confident, I'm not cocky, so get it right
She bendin' over, but I want some head first
I don't even wanna know what the pussy like
Trippin' too close to fallin', so I'm ballin'
It's crazy, my opp got shot but I ain't call it 
I come around, niggas gon' put they ho up
These bitches stay on my channel, yeah
Must've seen me on TV, yeah
It took me six hours to count a mil' exactly, I'm accurate with the cheese, yeah 
Huh? 
Ah, I thought a broke nigga said somethin'

You don't wanna let no sucker look you in your eyes, huh?
Better show off them eyelashes
You love what you do with a passion
Ooh, that shit attractive
I fuck with you, girl
All he wanna do is gas me
How we end up in the backseat?
Just tryna get to the bag
We on the same page, you the same way
Only keep the fam around me
So let me know what it's gon' be
I don't plan on gettin' no sleep, while we
Doin' our thing, movin' too fast
Candy paint with the windows all black
Seats crème brûlée, what they gon' say?
With the top down screamin', ""Money ain't a thing""
And we up 'til six in the mornin'
When the sun rise, we be on it
Ooh, I got five, you know it's all live
Tell me when to go, baby, when we gon' slide?
Baby, when we gon' slide? Hey, hey
Up all night, baby, when we gon' slide? Oh, yeah, yeah
Baby when we gon' slide, slide, slide, slide?
Slide, uh
I don't care if we on the run
Nothin' matters when we one on one
Lookin' at us 'cause we goin' dumb
We on the same wave, you the same way
You know I be down if it's with you
Where we goin'? Baby, what's the move?
We should take a trip up to the moon
Get a room

Up all night, baby, when we gon' slide? Yeah

I need a baecation
I need my bitch in an apron
Booty all out cookin' bacon
Orange juice and Ace what we drinkin'
I only come out when the stars out
I'm on a mission, but we far out
This city talkin' with a large mouth
Yeah, they after the boy like Fall Out
 
Drop it, give me fifty, girl, drop it, give me fifty
You should slide with me 'cause you be trippin' when you miss me
You gon' hold me close and on your neck gon' be a hickie
I ain't gotta do too much, I know what get you sticky
I ain't gotta know astrology, I know your vibe
Skip the foreplay, you don't let niggas fuck with your mind
I ain't givin' out apologies when I'm behind
Fuckin' up the seats of the brand new ride
Doin' our thing, movin' too fast
Candy paint with the windows all black
Seats crème brûlée, what they gon' say?
With the top down screamin', ""Money ain't a thing""

NLE the Top Shotta
Uh, posted , in front of the trap 
Selling dope 'til the sun come down 
Take a fuck nigga right off the map 
When I hit him with this whole hundred rounds 
Yung Joc, in the club with my Glock 
You want to play, and then this bitch going down 
We ain't hesitatin', bullets get to blazin' 
I'ma lay him down like he in the lounge
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk down on 'em in Balenciaga runners
My blood slime a nigga out just like an anaconda
You go against me, then you fucked just like a used condom
 
I roll 'em up and then I smoke 'em like some good ganja, ayy 
Still doing drive-bys, but I wanna walk 'em 
If I can't find 'em, you know I'm gonna stalk 'em 
Caution tape up on the scene, I had to white chalk 'em 
Running from my gun, but my bullets had to hawk 'em 
Uh, posted , in front of the trap 
Selling dope 'til the sun come down 
Take a fuck nigga right off the map 
When I hit him with this whole hundred rounds

You want to play, and then this bitch going down 
We ain't hesitatin', bullets get to blazin' 
I'ma lay him down like he in the lounge
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Nigga, I was posted on the corner where the J's at
Roll up in the four by four, pull up at the corner store
And I got red in my drink when I pour up soda
I remember prayin' that the feds never take the Motorola
Choppa got the chopper, make 'em do a backflip
Pay my dawg a dime to walk him down, he need the racks, bitch
I been drinkin', I been taking all this codeine to the face
Got a lot of M's in the safe
Caught a murder, then I beat the case
I was just about to do the race
Uh, posted , in front of the trap 
Selling dope 'til the sun come down 
Take a fuck nigga right off the map 
When I hit him with this whole hundred rounds 
Yung Joc, in the club with my Glock 
You want to play, and then this bitch going down 
We ain't hesitatin', bullets get to blazin' 
I'ma lay him down like he in the lounge
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down"
