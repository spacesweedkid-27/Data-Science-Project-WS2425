2,"""Thinking Out Loud""",Ed Sheeran,https://genius.com/Ed-sheeran-thinking-out-loud-lyrics,"When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't 
sweep
 you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darlin', I will be lovin' you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Oh, I'll just keep on makin' the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
That, baby, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are, oh-oh
Lo-lo-lo, lo-lo-lo
Lo-lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, love
So baby, now, take me into your lovin' arms
And kiss me under the light of a thousand stars, oh, darlin'
Place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh, maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are"

Without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way
From where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standin' right here talkin' to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But somethin' told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days,
 
hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standin' there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
[Chorus: Charlie Puth & 
Wiz Khalifa

It's been a long day
Without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (

From where we began (
You know where we started

Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (

When I see you again
[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth & 
Wiz Khalifa
]
Oh, oh
Ooh (
Yeah
)
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feelin' strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond'll never be broken, the love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first, then the line'll never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standin' there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day
Without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way
From where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth & 
Wiz Khalifa

I'm like ""Hey, what's up? Hello"" 
Seen yo pretty ass soon as you came in the door
I just wanna chill, got a sack for us to roll
Married to the money, introduced her to my stove
Showed her how to whip it, now she remixin' for low
She my trap queen, let her hit the bando
We be countin' up, watch how far them bands go
We just set a goal, talkin' matchin' Lambos
At 56 a gram, 5 a hundred grams though
Man, I swear I love her, how she work the damn pole
Hit the strip club, we be lettin' bands go
Everybody hatin', we just call them fans, though
In love with the money, I ain't never lettin' go
And I get high with my baby 
I just left the mall, I'm gettin' fly with my baby, yeah
And I can ride with my baby 
I be in the kitchen cookin' pies with my baby, yeah
And I can ride with my baby 
I just left the mall, I'm gettin' fly with my baby, yeah
And I can ride with my baby
I be in the kitchen cookin' pies
I'm like, ""Hey, what's up? Hello""
I hit the strip with my trap queen, 'cause all we know is bands
I just might snatch up a 'Rari and buy my boo a Lamb'
I just might snatch her a necklace, drop a couple on a ring
She ain't wantin' for nothin' because I got her everything
It's big ZooWap from the bando
Remind me where I can't go
Remy Boyz got the stamp though
Count up hella them bands though
Boy how far can your bands go?
Fetty Wap, I'm livin' fifty thousand K how I stand though
If you checkin' for my pockets I'm like…
And I get high with my baby 
I just left the mall, I'm gettin' fly with my baby, yeah
And I can ride with my baby

Just keep your eyes on me""
I said, ""You're holding back""
She said, ""Shut up and dance with me""
This woman is my destiny
She said, ooh-ooh, shut up and dance with me
We were victims of the night
The chemical, physical kryptonite
Helpless to the bass and the fading light
Oh, we were bound to get together
Bound to get together
She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said
""Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me""
I said, ""You're holding back""
She said, ""Shut up and dance with me""
This woman is my destiny
She said, ooh-ooh, shut up and dance with me
A backless dress and some beat-up sneaks
My discothèque Juliet, teenage dream
I felt it in my chest as she looked at me
I knew we were bound to be together
Bound to be together
She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said
""Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me""
I said, ""You're holding back""
She said, ""Shut up and dance with me""
This woman is my destiny
She said, ooh-ooh, shut up and dance with me
Oh, c'mon, girl
Deep in her eyes
I think I see the future
I realize this is my last chance
She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said
""Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me""

7,"""Blank Space""",Taylor Swift,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-blank-space-lyrics,"Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"" Ayy
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing, like
""Oh, my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless 
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless , mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane 
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over , mm

8,"""Watch Me""",Silentó,https://genius.com/Computerwife-no-patience-lyrics,"I have zero patience for this endless institution
I have been pathetic for a year
I don't think you understand that I have been alluding
To a monumental 
But I'm back inside a haze again
If I could always see this way
I'd be content every day
Bored forever
I didn't know what I had missed
Until I felt this gentleness
Let's sink into the easy life together
I don't feel at home in my life here anymore
Throwing up on the bed watch me
Silent on the door
I wokе up dreaming of a chain tied to my neck
Evеn when I'm sleeping there's a tendency towards threat
I wanna feel that haze again
You can't be satisfied with all my anger streaks
But I'd never act that way if you were here with me
Didn't know what I had missing
Until I felt this gentleness
Let's sink into this easy life together
Don't you miss being by my side together
Don't you miss being by my side together
Let's sink into this easy life together"

Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
She walks like a model
She grants my wishes like a genie in a bottle, yeah, yeah
'Cause I'm the wizard of love
And I got the magic wand
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say
""Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheatin'?""
And I'm like, ""No, not really"", 'cause
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
She gives me love and affection, baby, did I mention?
You're the only girl for me, no, I don't need a next one
Mama loves you too, she thinks I made the right selection
Now all that's left to do is just for me to pop the question
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her"

She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's gettin' more bleak
A fresh poison each week
We were born sick, you heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well
A, amen
Amen, amen
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea, get somethin' shiny
Somethin' meaty for the main course
That's a fine lookin' high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starvin' faithful
That looks tasty, that looks plenty
This is hungry work
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then, I am human, only then, I am clean
Oh, oh, amen
Amen, amen
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death

You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin
What was shiny? Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me
Where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughin' right at me

Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past
These kinda wounds, they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't

Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home
Lovin' can heal
Lovin' can mend your soul

I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
Mm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die

Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
So hello from the other side 
I must've called a thousand times 
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside 
At least, I can say that I've tried 
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
 Ooh, anymore
 Ooh, anymore
 Ooh, anymore

To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done

We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey-ya, oh, hey, hey-ya
Remember me for centuries
Mummified my teenage dreams
No, it's nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong, the story's all off
Heavy metal broke my heart
Come on, come on and let me in
Bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
And this is supposed to match the darkness that you felt
I never meant for you to fix yourself

Remember me for centuries
And I can't stop 'til the whole world knows my name
'Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as there's a light
My shadow's over you
'Cause I, I am the opposite of amnesia
And you're a cherry blossom, you're about to bloom
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon

We've been here forever

How dare that nigga run his mouth
When his pockets in a drought

Didn't even make it out
And he dumb as hell and I swear his ass don't think, ayy
If he disrespect, two shots and I won't blink, ayy
Never really cared what the fuck these niggas think, ayy

Countin' all this bread, I don't talk to feds
Try and take my bitch, you gonna take two to the head
'Cause baby you the baddest

all this money, I'ma cash it
And I'm swervin' all in traffic
While I'm trappin' out the mansion

You're not looking for anything right now
So, I don't wanna come on strong

And some guys gettin' too close
Trying to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk
And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
'Cause she's supposed to save you from random guys that talk too much
And wanna stay too long
It's the same old song
And dance, but I think you know it well
You could've rolled your eyes, told me to go to hell
Could've walked away, but you're still here

Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental

Barely Harley, I'm chromeless , you might end up domeless 
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever like the Statue of Liberty 
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South

I guess drama makes for the best content

Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious , feel me?
When you get a fine bitch, just don't forget to read the fine print

That's 'cause I believe in somethin', I stand for it
And Nicki, if you ever tryna fuck
Just give me the heads-up, so I can plan for it

If I did fuck, she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
'Cause she act like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story-teller
I piss greatness, like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she wave
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' 'bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, masked up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga
I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the ""B"" off behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean ""pop-pop-pop,"" then I take off
Nigga, now you see me, nigga, now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx actin' like Ray Charles
Sixteen in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with seventeen bullets
My story is how I went from ""poor me""
To ""please pour me a drink and celebrate with me""

Throw some hundreds on that ass, walk her out the club
 Lap dance for the first date
Bet I threw a few bands, that’s third base
It’s okay if you work late
We can still party like it’s your birthday
We can still party hard in your birthday suit
Knock that pussy out the park like my name Babe Ruth
Shawty she just want a tip, I just want to see her strip
If you fuck me like you love me shawty you might get rich
Have her own cake, her own place
Blow her own gas, no Rolaid

Tell her friend to join in both ways

And his voice is a familiar sound

He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is

Why disagree? Why, why disagree?
You've gotta know how to treat me like a lady
Even when I'm actin' crazy
Tell me everything's alright 
Dear future husband
Here's a few things you'll need to know if
You wanna be my one and only
All my life 
Dear future husband
Make time for me, don't leave me lonely
And no, we'll never see your family more than mine
I'll be sleeping on the left side of the bed 
Open doors for me and you might get some... kisses
Don't have a dirty mind, just be a classy guy
Buy me a ring, buy, buy me a ring, babe
You've gotta know how to treat me like a lady
Even when I'm actin' crazy
Tell me everything's alright 
Dear future husband
Here's a few things you'll need to know if
You wanna be my one and only
All my life
Dear future husband
If you wanna get that special lovin'
Tell me I'm beautiful each and every night 
 Future husband, better love me right"

Coming to the tree?
Where they strung up a man

If we met at midnight in the hanging tree

Where a dead man called out
For his love to flee
Strange things did happen here, no stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree

Coming to the tree?
Where I told you to run
So we'd both be free
Strange things did happen here, no stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree

Coming to the tree?
Wear a necklace of hope
Side by side with me
Strange things did happen here, no stranger would it be

That one day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story
Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're all right?
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight
I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call? 
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy
You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're all right?
I'll take care of you

Nobody flippin' packs now
I just did three in a row
Them shows is back-to-back to back now
Put the world on our sound
You know PARTY and The Weeknd
Ain't got no motherfuckin' time
To party on the weekend
Tell Gelo bring the juice
We about to get lit
Fill the room up with some tings
One night off and this is it
Always workin' OT
Overtime and out of town
Shit is crazy back home
It kills me that I'm not around
I think we gettin' too deep
Shit I'm talkin' might be too true
Upstairs I got Xans in an Advil bottle
I don't take them shits but you do
So I got 'em for you
I don't need the pills
I'm just gon' have another drink

On the corner flippin' hard
Made at least three thousand
On the boulevard
I've been workin' graveyard
Shifts every other weekend
Ain't got no fuckin' time
To party on the weekend
I've been flippin' in the house
Makin' juggs on the highway
I've been ridin' out of state
Makin' money like my way
I don't think that I should dance
I'm just gon' have another drink
I'm doin' my stance
You know my molly pink
I got the loudest of the loud
You know my gas stink
My P.O. think I'm in the house
Don't give a damn 'bout what she think
Got the club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday

Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey

I made my own style

If you're in the mood, sit tight right where you are, babe
'Cause I'll be at your door in ten minutes
Whatever you got on, girl, stay in it
You ain't gotta leave the house to have a good time
I'ma bring the good time home to you
We'll have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boombox out
We'll wake up all the neighbors 'til the whole block hates us
And the cops show up and try to shut us down
If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
Throw a neon t-shirt over the lamp shade
I'll take the furniture, slide it out of the way
Shakin' the floor, rattlin' the roof
We'll go to town right there in your living room
Let's have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boombox out

All week long it’s a farmin’ town
They’re makin’ that money grow
Tractors, plows with flashing lights
Backin’ up a two lane road
They take one last lap around
That sun up high goes down
And then it's on, come on
Girl kick it on back

We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let’s tear it up, up
And kick the dust up 
Bar downtown they got a line
Of people way out the door
$10 dollar drinks, it’s packed inside
I don’t know what they’re waitin for
Got me a jar full of clear
And I got that music for your ears
And it’s like knock, knock, knock goes the diesel
If you really wanna see the beautiful people
We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out

Back it on up
Fill your cup up

Fuck a vacay, I feel better at work
I mean, whatever it's worth, I'll give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gon' go to Hell and back for me, I'ma give 'em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life, man, that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like, ""Father, forgive me, these are all my confessions""
Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd n Eddy
Who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you ""dog,"" that shit get-get petty
Bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back is that it just keep comin' back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after 3
Man, this is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty
Man, the clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The fee not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Young prophet with profit, oh God

So I'm going over time on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million-dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never goin' anorexic
I pay my own mortgage and electric
Never goin' under, even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checkin' off my checklist
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons

You tore the game apart, who put it back together?

They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God, I hope they post it, I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three POs like Star Wars
They want me by the road holdin' up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, I'm callin' you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga, I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there gettin' homeschooled, I'm blessed
And I was thinking 'bout starting up my own school, a Montessori
And the hallway lookin' like a monastery, oh, yes
I'm way up, I feel blessed"

She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her, ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's stayin' at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missin' it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissin' him, how I was confused about
Now, she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was cryin' on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next 
(
Get lost
)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
 
(
Get lost
)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were stayin' on the same **** hotel floor
And I wasn't lookin' for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singin'
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe"

You tried hiding another you

Bright light living in the shade

Had to meet the devil just to know his name
And that's when my love was burning
Yeah, it's still burning!

True pain I don't deserve
Truth is that I never learned
I keep going to the river to pray 
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain 
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away 
But your ghost, the ghost of you 
It keeps me awake
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
Give up the ghost, give up the ghost
Give up the ghost, stop the haunting baby
Give up the ghost, give up the ghost
Give up the ghost, no more haunting baby
I keep going to the river
I keep going to the river to pray 
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain 
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you 
It keeps me awake
I keep going to the river to pray 
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain 
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you 
It keeps me awake"
94,"""Here""",Alessia Cara,https://genius.com/Alessia-cara-here-lyrics,"I guess right now you've got the last laugh
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really, I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So, you can go back, please, enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
 with this boy who's hollerin'
I can hardly hear over this music I don't listen to
And 
I don't wanna get with you, so tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
, 
but honestly, I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan to take over the planet
So, pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
So, tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God, why am I here?
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Hours later, congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
And I can't wait till we can break up out of here"

My paranoia gettin' worse and my anxiety high
Mind got me stayin' in the eye of the fire
Sometimes, I don't know if I'ma drown or fly
Heart so big, I be down to die
For all the ones I love, too bad they don't think I really love 'em
They don't understand that there just so many of 'em
Hustle's got so many of 'em, everybody pullin' at me
Can't leave the house without everybody lookin' at me

That my wife was at my wake with my son
He said, ""Look at daddy""

Me dijeron que te estás casando
Tú no sabes cómo estoy sufriendo
Esto te lo tengo que decir
Cuéntame, tu despedida para mí fue dura
Será que te llevó a la luna
Y yo no supe hacerlo así
Te estaba buscando
Por las calles gritando
Esto me está matando, oh no
Te estaba buscando
Por las calles gritando
Como un loco tomando
Es que yo sin ti, y tú sin mí
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Esto no me gusta
Esto no me gusta
Es que yo sin ti, y tú sin mí
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Eso no me gusta
Eso no me gusta
Vivir sin ti, no aguanto más
Por eso vengo a decirte lo que siento
Estoy sufriendo en esta soledad
Y aunque tu padre no aprobó esta relación
Yo sigo insistiendo a pedirte perdón
Lo único que importa está en tu corazón
Te estaba buscando
Por las calles gritando
Esto me está matando, oh no
Te estaba buscando
Por las calles gritando
Como un loco tomando
Es que yo sin ti, y tú sin mí
Dime quién puede ser feliz

Es que yo sin ti, y tú sin mí
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Eso no me gusta

Yo te juré a ti eterno amor
Y ahora otro te da calor
Cuando en las noches tienes frío, oh-oh, oh
Yo sé que te parece mejor
Pero yo estoy en tu corazón
Y por eso pido perdón
Es que yo sin ti, y tú sin mí
Dime quién puede ser feliz

Baby, I'm horny and I ain't too proud to beg
Instead show me the bed
Early morning breakfast and head
And I got Tina, Tasha and Toya, I call ‘em the triple threat
All them bitches be soaking wet
This the first night them bitches met
You know from the moment she turn around
She know how to back it up and drop it down
She know she what all the fellas looking at
Cause they know soon as her song come on it's a wrap
And she loves the attention

Like a soap opera, watch all my children
Hit it so long that she might lose feeling
With her legs in the air, she gon' walk on the ceiling

I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Woah—very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith, playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one
I got the drink in me, going back to back
Yeah, going back to back
I got the drink in me, going back to back
Yeah, I'm going back to back
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell him that they better as friends
Not even when you saying, ""Drizzy, tell 'em again!""
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you'd do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back

They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
