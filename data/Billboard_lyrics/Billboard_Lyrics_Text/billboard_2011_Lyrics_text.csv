1,"""Rolling in the Deep""",Adele,https://genius.com/Adele-rolling-in-the-deep-lyrics,"There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could've had it all
 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside of your hand
 
And you played it to the beat
 
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared
 
The scars of your love remind me of us
 They keep me 
thinkin' that we almost had it all
 
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
 
I can't help feeling
We could've had it all
 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside of your hand 
And you played it to the beat
 
Could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating
Throw your soul through every open door 
Count your blessings to find what you look for 
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold 
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown
We could've had it all 
We could've had it all, yeah
 
It all, it all, it all 
We could've had it all
 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside of your hand 
And you played it to the beat
 
Could've had it all
 
Rolling in the deep 
You had my heart inside of your hand 
But you played it, you played it, you played it
You played it to the beat"

3,"""Firework""",Katy Perry,https://genius.com/Katy-perry-firework-lyrics,"Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Awe, awe, awe""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Awe, awe, awe""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Awe, awe, awe""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Awe, awe, awe""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
""Boom, boom, boom""
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it throu-ou-ough
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Awe, awe, awe,""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Awe, awe, awe""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
""Boom, boom, boom""
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
""Boom, boom, boom""
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon"
4,"""E.T.""",Katy Perry featuring Kanye West,https://genius.com/Katy-perry-et-lyrics,"You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil? Could you be an angel?
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like I am floating, leaves my body glowing
They say, ""Be afraid""
You're not like the others, futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin', fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial
You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers, stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin', fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial
This is transcendental
On another level
Boy, you're my lucky star
I wanna walk on your wavelength
And be there when you vibrate
For you, I'll risk it all
All
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin', fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign

Pitbull, Nayer, Ne-Yo, that's right
[Chorus: Ne-Yo & 
Nayer

Tonight, I want all of you
Tonight, give me everything
Tonight, for all we know
We might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight
Don't care what they say
Or what games they play
Nothing is enough
'Til they handle love
 
I want you tonight
I want you to stay
I want you tonight
Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em, ""Hey""
 Give me everything tonight
 Give me everything tonight 
 Give me everything tonight 
 Give me everything tonight
Take advantage of tonight 
'Cause tomorrow I'm off to Dubai to perform for a princess
But tonight, I can make you my queen
And make love to you endless 
It's insane, the way the name growin' 
Money keep flowin', hustlers move in silence 
So, I'm tiptoein', to keep flowin' 
I got it locked up like Lindsay Lohan 
Put it on my life, baby 
I'll make ya feel right, baby
Can't promise tomorrow
But I promise tonight, dale

 Give me everything tonight 
 Give me everything tonight 
 Give me everything tonight
Reach for the stars and if you don't grab them
At least you'll fall on top of the world
Think about it, 'cause if you slip
I'm gon' fall on top of your girl, ha-ha-ha-ha
What I'm involved with is deeper than the Mason's baby
Baby, and it ain't no secret
My family's from Cuba, but I'm an American idol
Gettin' money like Seacrest 
Put it on my life, baby 
I'll make you feel right, baby 
Can't promise tomorrow

6,"""Grenade""",Bruno Mars,https://genius.com/Bruno-mars-grenade-lyrics,"Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live
Oh, take, take, take it all but you never give
Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open, why were they open?
Gave you all I had, and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
'Cause what you don't understand is
I'd catch a grenade for ya 
Throw my hand on a blade for ya 
I'd jump in front of a train for ya 
You know I'd do anything for ya , oh, oh
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same
No, no, no, no
Uh
Black, black, black and blue, beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said ""hey"" when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman, that's just what you are
Yeah, you'll smile in my face, then rip the brakes out my car
Gave you all I had, and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
'Cause what you don't understand is
I'd catch a grenade for ya 
Throw my hand on a blade for ya 
I'd jump in front of a train for ya 
You know I'd do anything for ya , oh, oh
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same
If my body was on fire
Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me, you're a liar
'Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby
 But darlin', I'd still catch a grenade for ya 
Throw my hand on a blade for ya 
I'd jump in front of a train for ya 
You know I'd do anything for ya , oh, oh
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same
No, you won't do the same
You wouldn't do the same
Ooh, you'd never do the same
No, no, no, no"
7,"""Fuck You (Forget You)""",CeeLo Green,https://genius.com/Brogodsteph-rough-draft-lyrics," 
It's pretty accurate, if you say I'm the opposite of immaculate
And I complicate like calculus
Life is a bitch, pretty emasculate
I guess I am life Cuz I can act like it
Shining like an amulet
, 
and my flow is masculine
Your flow is busted like ejaculate
I'm like a crappy Christmas
I'm always rapping shit
And I'm more messed up than a glitch
Sean is my only Ohana, watch Lilo and Stitch
What's the point of having bars if you can't share it
People are so ignorant, what's the point of having money if you aren't rich
In mind and spirit
Flow got drive like I need the second gear bitch
Lost in the game like Nemo
Tryna forget you like Celo
But my green will be fatter than he though
My feelings can't be understood like Migos
Skin more black than Emo
Flow more sick then Chemo
Heart weighs a kilo
Wishing money was in my genes
But I have chinos
 
Storming on y'all like my name is El Nino
  
In the game like Nintendo or a Casino
I be taking a chance by chilling in my Sweatpants like Gambino
Fly like Rio
, 
taking the game like repo
Spitting the acid like amino
This game is my home like depot
There's tools and screws
They can get popped like a cherry, but y'all fake like Maraschino
I need to breathe though
 
Going hard on the beat like falling on the concrete
Flow needs to be censored like bleep
Y'all flow is busted like skeet
Drive like a Jeep
, 
no mills I ain't meek
Flow so deadly have you 6 feet deep
So deadly like your family about to grieve
I'm the Chief like Keef
I don't appeal to the masses
Because the majority like him
Only liking songs for the beat like Rihanna, Janay, and Kim
Or like that fagot
Or the niggas who be trapping
They be talking about catching shots the face like a pornstar
Or playing these bitches like an Indian and the sitar
Y'all Under my skin like itches
Y'all always barking y'all bitches
Bitch I'm a ruler I ain't talking bout inches
Roll up on that nigga with the 40, he don't see it Cuz my windows is tinted
Yo Steph you should do a second rough draft
This is the only
Nah fuck that, bring this to the teacher to check that"

DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue

Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked-out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn
Last Friday night, yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots, think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night, yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night, we went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night, yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh-woah
But this Friday night
Do it all again
But this Friday night
Do it all again
Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrant's out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

You can't even get in
Hahaha
Leggo
Yellow model chick, yellow bottle sippin'
Yellow Lamborghini, yellow top missin'
Yeah, yeah, that shit look like a toupée
I get what you get in ten years in two days
Ladies love me, I'm on my Cool J
If you get what I get, what would you say?
She wax it all off, Mr. Miyagi
And them suicide doors, hari-kari
Look at me now,  look at me now
 
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now , look at me now
 
Fresher than a muh'fucka
Lil' nigga, bigger than gorilla
'Cause I'm killin' every nigga that can try to be on my shit
Better cuff your chick if you with her, I can get her
And she accidentally slip and fall on my dick
Oops, I said ""On my dick""
I ain't really mean to say ""On my dick""
But since we talkin' about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it
I'm done
Ayo, Breezy
Let me show you how to keep the dice rollin'
When you're doin' that thing over there, homie
Let's go
'Cause I'm feelin' like I'm runnin'
And I'm feelin' like I gotta get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
'Cause you know I gotta win everyday-day 
See, they really really wanna pop me 
Just know that you will never flop me 
And I know that I can be a little cocky 
You ain't never gonna stop me
Every time I come, a nigga gotta set it
Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it 
Then I gotta blow, and then I gotta show that
Any little thing a nigga think that he be doin' 
'Cause it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm gonna da-da-da-da 
Then I'm gonna murder everything and anything
A ba-da-boom, a ba-da-bing,
 I gotta do a lotta things
That make it clearer to a couple niggas that I always win
And then I gotta get it again and again and then again
And I be doin' it to death
And now I move a little foul, a nigga better call a ref
And everybody know my style and niggas know that I'm the best
When it come to doin' this and I be bangin' on my chest
And I bang in the East and I'm bangin' in the West
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you could read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next? 
See the way we on and then we all up in the race
And you know we gotta go, don't try to keep up with the pace
And we strugglin' and hustlin' and sendin' in and gettin'
And we always gotta do it, take it to another place
Gotta taste it and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne
Better know I gotta have it 
Look at me now, look at me now
 
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now , look at me now
 
Fresher than a muh'fucka
Man, fuck these bitch-ass niggas
How y'all doin'? I'm Lil Tunechi
I'm a nuisance
, 
I go stupid
I go dumb like the Three Stooges
I don't eat sushi, I'm the shit
No, I'm pollution, no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies
In my jacuzzi, pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater
Got money on my radar, dressed like a skater
Got a big house, came with an elevator
You niggas ain't eatin', fuck it, tell a waiter
Marley said ""shoot 'em,"" and I said ""okay""
If you on that bullshit, then I'm like, ""Olé""
I don't care what you say, so don't even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
That's word to my flag and my flag red
I'm outta my head, bitch, I'm outta my mind
From the bottom, I climb, you ain't hotter than mine
Nope, not on my time and I'm not even tryin'
What's poppin', slime? Nothin', five
And if they trippin', fuck 'em, five
I ain't got no time to shuck and jive
These niggas as sweet as pumpkin pie
CîROC and Sprite on a private flight
Bitch, I been tight since 
Guiding Light
And my pockets right, and my diamonds white
And my momma's nice, and my daddy's dead
You faggots scared 'cause I'm too wild
Been here for a while, I was like, ""Fuck trial""
I puts it down, I'm so Young Money
If you got eyes, look at me now, bitch
Look at me now, look at me now

Look at me now , look at me now

But you can't have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you're sittin' here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder
See you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart

The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listenin', but
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartendin' and strippin', baby
So don't be mad, nobody else trippin'

You see, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out

That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Never mind, I'll find someone like you

Seven days of torture,

And my girlfriend went and cheated on me
She's a California dime, but it's time for me to quit her
La-la-la, whatever
La-la-la, it doesn't matter

We're goin' at it tonight, tonight
There's a party on the rooftop, top of the world, tonight, tonight
And we're dancin' on the edge of the Hollywood sign
I don't know if I'll make it
But watch how good I'll fake it
It's alright, alright, tonight, tonight
I woke up with a strange tattoo
Not sure how I got it, not a dollar in my pocket
And it kinda looks just like you
Mixed with Zach Galifianakis, huh?

Livin' out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters
By the time you hear this, I will have already spiralled up
I would never do nothin' to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightnin'
Fighters keep fightin', put your lighters up, point 'em skyward, uh
Had a dream, I was king; I woke up, still king
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking
'Til nobody else even fuckin' feels me, 'til it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fuckin' illest in this music
There is, or there ever will be, disagree? Feel free
But from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up's using no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped your life around, crock of shit
Who you dicks tryna kid? Flip ""dick,"" you did opposite
You stayed the same 'cause ""cock"" backwards is still ""cock,"" you pricks!
I love it when I tell 'em shove it
'Cause it wasn't that long ago when Marshall sat flustered
Lacked luster 'cause he couldn't cut mustard
Muster up nothin', brain fuzzy
'Cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzz and
Now you wonder why he does it how he does it
Wasn't 'cause he had buzzards
Circlin' around his head, waitin' for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it 'cause some bitches wrote him off?
Little hussy-ass scuzzes
Fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it?
What difference it make? What's it take?
To get it through your thick skulls that this ain't
Some bullshit; people don't usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switchblade to a hater's ribcage!
And let it be known that from this day forward, I wanna just say
Thanks, 'cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let them Bics raise, 'cause I came with 5'9"", but I feel like I'm 6'8""
This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters
By the time you hear this, I'll prolly already be outtie
I advance like goin' from totin' iron to goin' and buyin'
Four or five of the homies the 
Iron Man Audi
My daddy told me: ""Slow down, boy, you're goin' to blow it!""
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute to tell Shady I love him
The same way that he did Dr. Dre on 
The Chronic
Tell him how real he is, or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him, for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I write 'til he can march right
Into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's LeBron's Jersey in twenty years
I stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up, it's 'bout to be a scary drop
'Cause what goes up must come down
You goin' down on somethin' you don't wanna see, like a hairy box
Every hour, happy hour now, life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cat's meow, oww, outclass the count
Always down for the catchweight like Pacquiao
Y'all are doomed
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself, and auto-tunes
'Cause now I'm in the Aston;
 
I went from havin'
My city locked up to gettin' treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic, compare it to a weed high
And y'all niggas that's gossipin' like bitches
On the radio and TV, see me, we fly
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams starin' at a beehive
And how real is that? I remember signin' my first deal
Now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag
You and I know what it's like
To be kicked down, forced to fight
But tonight, we're all right
So hold up your lights
Let it shine, 'cause—
This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters"

Who would have thought forever could be severed by
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts—oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
Funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Ooh, ooh, the ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em
Oh, the sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

But you deal with it 
And you keep ballin' 
Pour out some liquor, playboy, and we keep ballin' 
Baby, we been livin' in sin
'Cause we been really in love, but we been livin' as friends
 
So you've been a guest in your own home 
It's time to make your house your home 
Pick up your phone, come on 
[Chorus: Skylar Grey with Dawn Richard & Kalenna Harper,

I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home
Tell the world that I'm comin' home 
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes 
I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home 
Tell the world that I'm comin' home 
[Verse 3: Diddy, 
Kalenna Harper

""Ain't No Stopping Us Now,"" I love that song
Whenever it comes on, it makes me feel strong
I thought I told y'all that we won't stop
 
Till we back cruisin' through Harlem
, 
these old blocks 
It's what made me , saved me, drove me crazy
 
Drove me away , then embraced me
 
Forgave me for all of my shortcomings 
 
Welcome to my homecomin' 
Yeah, it's been a long time comin'
Lot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles
Lot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs
Made it back, lost my dog 
But here I stand  
A better man  
Thank you, Lord! 
Thank you all!

I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home

I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home

Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat; call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia

and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy 'cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doin' this shit

Okay
I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp, I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these ma'fuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money...
 uh
Paper chasin', tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep, so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag, you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell
Yeah, word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine
Llama scream,
 
hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I-I play the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you niggas the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech,
 
I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch,
 
I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', amount I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler

I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind

tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love, keep throwin' my sign
In the middle, hit 'em up, piece on my side, ‘cause ain't no peace on my side

I've never opened up to anyone
So hard to hold back when I'm holding you in my arms
But we don't need to rush this
Let's just take it slow
Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
No, I don't wanna mess this thing up
No, I don't wanna push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby, I'm alright with just a kiss goodnight
I know that if we give this a little time
It'll only bring us closer to the love we wanna find
It's never felt so real
No, it's never felt so right

Load the truck up, hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire, spread the word
Light the bonfire, then call the girls
The king in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack 'n' Jim were a few good men
Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said, she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something y'all don't know
Man that talk is getting old
Ya better mind your business, man, watch your mouth
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out

And we like cornbread and biscuits
And if it's broke round here we fix it
I can take y'all where you need to go
Down to my hood, back in them woods
We do it different 'round here, that's right
But we sure do it good and we do it all night
See, if you really wanna know how it feels
To get off the road with trucks and four wheels
Jump on in, and man, tell your friends
We'll raise some hell where the blacktop ends
Chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights

Me and 40 back to work, but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate the bullshit, hate these fuckin' allegations
I'm just feelin' like the throne is for the takin' 
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
I don't really give a fuck and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only gettin' older, somebody should've told you
I'm on one, yeah
Fuck it, I'm on one, yeah
I said, ""I'm on one""
Fuck it, I'm on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple or could be pink
'Pendin' on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I'm on one
I said, ""Fuck it, I'm on one""
Huh
, 
I'm burnin' purple flowers, it's burnin' my chest
 
I bury the most cash and 
burnin' the rest
 
Walkin' on the clouds, suspended in thin air 
The ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear 
Burner in the belt, move the kids to the hills 
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on your neck and tell you, ""Everything is great"" 
Even though I'm out on bond and might be facing eight
Still runnin' with the same niggas 'til the death of me
Never seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully 
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams 
In a room full of money out in London as she screams? 
Huh, baby, I could take it there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So yeah, we on one, the feelin' ain’t fair 
And it's double M-G 'til I get the chair, chyeah

Yeah, too much money ain't enough money
You know the feds listenin'; nigga, what money?
I'm a made nigga, I should dust somethin'
You niggas on the bench, like the bus comin'
Huh, ain't nothin' sweet but the Swishers
I'm focused, might as well say, ""Cheese"" for the pictures
Ohh, I'm about to go Andre the Giant
You a sellout, but I ain't buyin'

Put an end to your world like the Mayans

You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
I told the world, one day, I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, everyday, it's just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack
But they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me,
 
I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me, you lost a son
Demons fightin' you,
 
it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me, and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options
There's nothin' else I can do 'cause—
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy, or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin', and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader
You're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me
When everyone was tellin' you don't sign me
Everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I'm cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now, maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith, and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up, Dre, I'm dyin', I need you
Come back, for fuck's sake, 'cause—
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers
When the chips were down, you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask where the fuck we been
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots
And the cracker's ass,
 
little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack-ass backwards producers, I'm back, bastards
One more CD, and then I'm packin' up my bags
And as I'm leavin',
 
I'll guarantee they'll scream
""Dre, don't leave us like that, man,"" 'cause—
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' outta time

But we're gonna start by
Drinking old cheap bottles of wine

Saying things we haven't for a while, a while, yeah
We're smiling but we're close to tears
Even after all these years
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting

She's in line at the dole with her head held high
While I just lost my job but didn't lose my pride
And we both know how
How we're going to make it work when it hurts
When you pick yourself up you get kicked to the dirt
Tryna make it work, but, man, these times are hard
But we're gonna start by
Drinking old cheap bottles of wine
Shit talking up all night
Doing things we haven't for a while, a while, yeah

Could have wrote you a line or two

You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinkin'
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So, if the chain is on your door, I understand
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""

Edge of the water; we were feeling alright
Back down a country road
The girls are always hot, and the beer is ice cold
Cadillac, horns on the hood
My buddy Frankie had his dad hook him up good
Girls smile when we roll by
They hop in the back, and we cruise to the river side
Never gonna grow up
Never gonna slow down
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show
We were doin' it right
We were comin' alive
Yeah, caught up in a Southern summer, a barefoot, blue jean night
Blue eyes and auburn hair
Sittin' lookin' pretty by the fire in a lawn chair
New to town, and new to me
Her ruby red lips was sippin' on sweet tea
Shot me in love like a shootin' star
So, I grabbed a beer and my ol' guitar
Then we sat around till the break of dawn
Howlin' and singin' our favorite song
Never gonna grow up
Never gonna slow down
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show
We were doin' it right
We were comin' alive

Pretend I don't live in it
Sunshine going to wash my blues away
Had sweet love but I lost it
She got too close so I fought it
Now I'm lost in the world trying to find me a better way
Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise
Wrote a note said be back in a minute
Bought a boat and I sailed off in it
Don't think anybody's going to miss me anyway
Mind on a permanent vacation
The ocean is my only medication
Wishing my condition ain't ever going to go away
Now I'm knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise
This champagne shore washing over me
It's a sweet sweet life living by the salty sea
One day you could be as lost as me
Change your geography
Maybe you might be
Knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

Grab a back, pack it light
You never know until you try
When you lose yourself
You find the key to paradise"

Horns are honking, I've about had it
I'm looking for an exit sign
Gotta get out of here, get it all off my mind
And like a memory from your grandpa's attic
A song comes slippin' through the radio static
Changing my mood
A little George Strait 1982
And it makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab my honey
Tear down some two-lane country
Who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take
Makes me wanna take a back road
I've been cooped up, tied down, 'bout forgotten
What a field looks like, full of corn and cotton
If I'm gonna hit a traffic jam
Well it better be a tractor man
So sick and tired of this interstate system
I need a curve and wind-a-twistin'
Dusty path to nowhere
With the wind blowing through my baby's hair
Yeah, makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab my honey
Tear down some two-lane country
Who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take
Makes me wanna take a back road
Some old back road
Maybe it's the feeling or maybe it's the freedom
Maybe it's that shady spot
Where we park the truck when the things get hot
Where we park the truck when the things get hot
And it makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab you honey
Tear down some two-lane country
Who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take
Makes me wanna take a back road
Some old back road, get right with my soul
Now all I gotta do is take some old back road
 to the shady spot where things get hot
 way down, way down
Way down some old back road"

Acting so damn mysterious
Got shades on your eyes
And your heels so high that you can't even have a good time

I've made a mess of me
The person that I've been lately
Ain’t who I want to be
But you stay here right beside me
Watch as the storm blows through
And I need you
'Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you
Gave me you
There's more here than what we’re seeing
A divine conspiracy
That you, an angel lovely
Could somehow fall for me
You'll always be love's great martyr
And I'll be the flattered fool
And I need you
Yeah!
God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you
On my own, I'm only
Half of what I could be
I can't do without you
We are stitched together
And what love has tethered
I pray we never undo
'Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
God gave me you for the ups and downs

Hell's Kitchen
 with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well, just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm danglin' my feet
I tried to pay attention, but attention paid me
Haters can't see me, nose-bleed seats
And today I went shoppin' and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split

I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry, call that whine 'n' dine
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say, ""Choose wisely,"" that's why I was chosen
Rockin' like asphalt, it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of Death and took its mask off

Oh but you were so shy, so was I
Maybe that's why it was so hard to believe
When you smiled and said to me
Are you gonna kiss me or not?
Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I like you a lot
But you're about to miss your shot
Are you gonna kiss me or what?
It was the best dang kiss that I ever had
Except for that long one after that
And I knew if I wanted this thing to last
Sooner or later I'd have to ask for your hand
So I took a chance
Bought a wedding band and I got down on one knee
And you smiled and said to me
Are you gonna kiss me or not?
Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I love you a lot
I think we've got a real good shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not?
So we planned it all out for the middle of June
From the wedding cake to the honeymoon
And your momma cried
When you walked down the aisle
When the preacher man said, ""Say I do""
I did and you did too
Then I lifted that veil
And saw your pretty smile and I said
Are you gonna kiss me or not?
Are we gonna do this or what?

I'ma, I'ma blow this bag up like it's my last 
I'ma, I'ma spend this cash up like it's my last 
And I'ma make it last , like it's my last
And I'm gone , can't remember where I am
But she forget about her man when they tell her who I am
And they introduce my fan, now she all up in my space
All, all up in my face, like, ""You remember who I am?""
Since I signed to Kan', I'm Louis Vuitton Sean
Up in Benny Han Han eatin' all the Wonton
 
Rosé rose over a little Chandon
Put her hands down my pants, now she rockin' Sean john
 
Man, I just ended up on everybody guest list 
I'm just doin' better than what everyone projected
I knew that I'd be here, so if you asked me how I feel 
I'ma just tell you, it's everythin' that I expected, bitch

Hands up in the air (
The air
, 
do it
)
One time for the Westside, Westside 
Let me see them
 hands up in the air (
The air
, 
D-Town
)
Two times if you love G.O.O.D. Music
Hands up in the air (
The air
, 
boi, boi, boi
)
And three times for the baddest chick in the world who got her
Hands up in the air (
The air
, 
do it, yeah
)

Now I'ma hit this drink up 
like it's my last 
I'ma, I'ma hit this night up like it's my last 
I'ma, I'ma hit this ass up like it's my last
 (
Do it
)
I swear I'ma, swear I'ma do it like I (Oh-woah
, 
oh, do it
)
Like I never had it at a-a-a-all 
A-A-A-All
Like I, like I never had it at 
a-a-a-all
 (
Oh
)
Like I never had it at all, a-a-a-all 
[Verse 3: Chris Brown, 
Chris Brown & Big Sean

Big ass bottles, big ice buckets
I work too hard to be ballin' on a budget
Me and my people do it big out in public
'Cause if you don't do it big, bitch, you ain't doin' nothin'
 
[Chorus: Chris Brown, 
Big Sean
, 
Chris Brown & Big Sean
]
And I'ma hit this drink up like it's my last
I'ma, I'ma hit this night up like it's my last
I'ma, I'ma hit this ass up like it's my last (
Boi
)
I swear I'ma, swear (
Boi
) I'ma do it like I (
Do it
)
Like I never had it at a-a-a-all (
Yeah
)
A-A-A-All (Oh, no, 
D-Town
)
Like I, like I never had it at
 a-a-a-all (At all, 
do it
)
A-A-A-All 
A-A-A-All
A-A-A-All
Like I, like I never had it at
 a-a-a-all 
Like I never had it at all, a-a-a-all"
