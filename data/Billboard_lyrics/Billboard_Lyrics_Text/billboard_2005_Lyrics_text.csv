1,"""We Belong Together""",Mariah Carey,https://genius.com/Mariah-carey-we-belong-together-lyrics,"Sweet love, yeah
I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I shoulda held on tight, I never shoulda let you go
I didn't know nothin', I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lyin' to myself
I couldn't have fathomed I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
Guess I didn't know you, guess I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything I never felt
The feelin' that I'm feelin' now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips 'cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give to have you lyin' by my side
Right here, 'cause, baby 
When you left, I lost a part of me 
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough? 
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? 
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better 
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together
I can't sleep at night when you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singin' to me, ""If you think you're lonely now""
Wait a minute, this is too deep 
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial, tryna catch a break
And then I hear Babyface, ""I only think of you""
And it's breakin' my heart
I'm tryna keep it together, but I'm fallin' apart
I'm feelin' all out of my element
Throwin' things, cryin'
Tryna figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feelin' inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby 
When you left, I lost a part of me 
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough? 
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? 
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better 
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together, baby
 
When you left, I lost a part of me 
It's still so hard to believe 
Come back, baby, please
'Cause we belong together
Who am I gonna lean on when times get rough? 
Who's gon' talk to me 'til the sun comes up? 
Who's gon' take your place? There ain't nobody better 
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together
We belong together"

Baby, I just don't get it, do you enjoy bein' hurt?
I know you smelled the perfume, the makeup on his shirt
You don't believe his stories, you know that they're all lies
Bad as you are, you stick around and I just don't know why
If I was your man, baby, you'd never worry 'bout what I do
I'd be comin' home, back to you, every night, doin' you right
You're the type of woman who deserves good things
Fistful of diamonds, a hand full of rings
Baby, you're a star
I just wanna show you you are
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be
Baby, you should let me love you, love you, love you
Love you
Yeah, listen
You're true beauty's description; looks so good that it hurts
You're a dime, plus 99, and it's a shame
Don't even know what you're worth
Everywhere you go, they stop and stare, 'cause you're bad and it shows
From your head to your toes, out of control
Baby, you know
If I was your man, baby, you'd never worry 'bout what I do
I'd be comin' home, back to you, every night, doin' you right

With me and you, it's whatever, girl, hey

6,"""Gold Digger""",Kanye West featuring Jamie Foxx,https://genius.com/Apologetix-bone-digger-lyrics,"== Bone Digger ==
Parody of ""Gold Digger"" by Kanye West 
They make a monkey right out of me -- Yes, they've been tryin' endlessly
Overeager bonediggers -- they never found that jigsaw piece
They make a monkey right out of me -- It makes for funky biology
I'm not the kid of some hominid, who comes from a lizard, whose mama was a fish
Now I ain't hatin' on the bone diggers, but I say evolution don't figure
Now, I ain't hatin' on the bone diggers, but I ain't never seen no holes bigger
It sounds like no evidence found, it sounds like their heads in the ground
It sounds like they're just too proud, it sounds quite boneheaded
You need to ponder whether evolution is wrong
Whether maybe you was put on under cover of dawn
They said, ""We can tell from rocks, we tell by the carbon""
'Cause this world has gotta flock of descendants of Charles Robert Darwin
But I'm lookin' for the odds at casinos
That life could come to be from random acids amino
Zero -- we know it's hocus pocus
And they wanna make all of that an accidental process?
O.K., let's pretend a fishy got some kids
That stood up on their fins and crawled up on land
Without evidence and here we are today
If you're trustin' in this worldview you better have faith
You know why? They make too much of nothin'
Stuff that I've heard it should have been on Mythbusters
Their best forensic samples couldn't cut the mustard
You don't care what none of us say you still trust it
 Now I ain't hatin' on the bone diggers 
But I say evolution don't figure 
Now, I ain't hatin' on the bone diggers 
But I ain't never seen no holes bigger 
It sounds like no evidence found 
It sounds like their heads in the ground 
It sounds like they're just too proud 
It sounds quite boneheaded
1859's the fateful year -- they've had 150 years to prove their great new theory
I know some funny ways they found support for some of it, kids
They made some hominids from parts of gibbons and pigs
Your museums are deceiving when you visit one they
Take a couple bones pawn it off as a primate
They were s'posed to find all sorts of life forms we could study
They went to the rocks and got dinosaurs in the muddy
They're talkin' down actin' like the Bible is so funny
Could've got dinos sooner if they tried Job 41-y
If it ain't no bunk, holler ""We want proof now, we want proof now, yeah!""
It's somethin' that'll make you mad
Cause all the links they had were either weak or bad
Great big digs since the 1860's
And after waiting and searchin' they found out it doesn't exist?
CHORUS
Now I ain't hating on the bone digger, no, not me
I've found trilobites in stone and some petrified trees
You know evolution ain't paleontology
Transition forms are lackin' -- got a hole up his sleeve
But -- the other option's not fun
So he gonna make you into a man out of that pond scum
This is his religion baby, don't be surprised
That fishy on all fours on his jeep's his messiah
So, let's no fight -- I won't abuse Darwin 'cause that's not nice
And they're gonna keep stallin' and tryin' to prove they're right though
And when you catch on we'll lead you back to the Bible
SECOND HALF OF CHORUS
Romans 1:18-20
The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness, since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse

The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, and I walk a—
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beatin'
Sometimes, I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then, I walk alone
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
I'm walkin' down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, and I walk a—
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beatin'
Sometimes, I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then, I walk alone
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah

Oh-oh, oh, oh
Seems like just yesterday
You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight
Everything, it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong
Now I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on
Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes
I told you everything
Opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright for once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside
'Cause I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on
Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes
Swallow me then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Seeing you, it kills me now
No, I don't cry on the outside
Anymore
Anymore
Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes
Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend

This clock never seemed so alive
I can't keep up and I can't back down
I've been losing so much time
'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to lose
And it's you and me and all other people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you
All of the things that I want to say just aren't coming out right
I'm tripping on words
You've got my head spinning
I don't know where to go from here
'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to prove
And it's you and me and all other people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you
There's something about you now
I can't quite figure out
Everything she does is beautiful
Everything she does is right
'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to lose
And it's you and me and all other people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you

Cause I'm the next big thing in
Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be
Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills, rollin' like a celebrity
Livin' in Beverly Hills
The truth is
I don't stand a chance
It's something that you're born into
And I just don't belong
No I don't, I'm just a no class, beat down fool
And I will always be that way
I might as well enjoy my life
And watch the stars play
Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be
Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills, rollin' like a celebrity
Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills, livin' in Beverly Hills"

Can you swear to me that you'll always be this way?
Show me how you feel
More than ever, baby

So when you tell me that you love me, know for sure
I don't wanna be lonely anymore
Oh, whoa

With my heart still on the mend
Open up to me, like you do your girlfriends
And you sing to me and it's harmony
Girl, what you do to me is everything
Make me say anything, just to get you back again
Why can't we just try?
I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this 
I don't wanna know the lover at my door

What if I could hold you 'till I feel you move inside me?

What if I gave my all my life to find some way to stand beside you?

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

(
I want a soldier
) The way you got it, I'm the hottest around
They'll know it when they see you rollin' them Impalas around
(
I got a soldier
) With the top down, feelin' the sounds
Quakin' and vibratin' your thighs, ridin' harder than guys
With the chrome wheels at the bottom, white leather inside
When them flames spittin' at you, tell 'em, ""Don't even try it""
Shoot it with 'Chelle and kick it with Kelly or holla at B
Ya gotta be G's, you way outta your league, please
We like them boys that be in them 'lacs leanin' 
Open their mouth, their grill gleamin' 
Candy paint, keep that wheel clean and 
They always be talkin' that country slang we like
They keep that beat that be in the back beatin' 
Eyes be so low from that chiefin' 
I love how he keep my body screamin' 
A rude boy that's good to me with street credibility
If his status ain't hood, I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier that ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things if you know what I mean
If his status ain't hood, I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier that ain't scared to stand up for me
Gotta know to get dough and he better be street
We like them boys up top from the B.K. 
Know how to flip that money three ways 
Always ridin' big on the freeway 
With that East Coast slang that us country girls, we like
Low-cut Caesar's with the deep waves 
So quick to snatch up your Beyoncé 
Always comin' down, boppin' our way 
Tellin' us that country girls the kind of girls they like
[Chorus: Destiny's Child & 
Beyoncé

If his status ain't hood (
Ain't hood

Better be street if he lookin' at me

If his status ain't hood, I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he lookin' at me

Gotta know to get dough and he better be street

Wouldn't mind puttin' that on me (

Next to the speakers, keep a toy in the trunk of the 'lac
A reformed D-boy, used to run into traps
Still a soldier, go to war if you runnin' your trap
About my girls, ain't no thing to put ya under the map 
Walk the streets, five-deep with nothin' less than a stack
And eighty carats on my chest provides a special attraction
Fifty Gs in my jeans, plus the dough from the white
It's a reason I'm the king, girl, I know what you like, come on

Ain't hood

Gotta know to get dough and he better be street

I like them boys over there, they lookin' strong tonight 
Just might give one the phone tonight 
Homie in the dickies in my zone tonight 
He don't know it might be on tonight
Oh, he lookin' good and he talkin' right

Body marked up like the subway in Harlem, call them
Weezy F. Baby, please say the ""baby""

Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreamin' of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray 
Trying hard to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I prayed 
I could break away
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

Travel on a jet plane
Far away 
And break away
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I love 
Take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging 'round revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me, but
Gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, break away
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly 
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun 
But I won't forget of the place I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

I mean real clean, ain't gotta touch or nothing
It ain't like I like a chick-on-chick or something

First one in, last one out the club
Bursting in, passing out in the club
Back at it, this cat is the wit and the charm

Shut your mouth, fool, get your crew and
The thick body and

And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby
That's what you told me and I believe it
'Cause I ain't neva had nobody do me like you
[Verse 1: Bow Wow, 
Ciara
]
Now, I done been with different kind of girls
Like I done seen them all but ain't none of them at all (
Like you
)
And I done seen the best of the best
Baby, still I ain't impressed cause ain't none of them at all (
Like you
)
If you know how I feel when I chill
If I'm seen with a girl, then she gotta be just (
Like you
)
And baby, that's the way I feel
And I got no choice but for me to keep it real
'Cause when we, first got together started hanging out you was
Skeptical at first had to figure out if
I was the kinda guy to try to dog you out, but
I ain't that kinda guy you tried to make me out
You found out when you turned to my baby
I showed them other brothers how to treat a lady
I let you drive when I ride that Mercedes
And I ain't trippin' or actin' shady cause baby, you know
I ain't never had nobody show me all the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby
That's what you told me and I believe it
Cause I ain't neva had nobody do me like you
And every time I think about you
When you ride, when you call, when you come 
Your love is amazing to me
I can't wait 'til I see you - I wanna be with you again
And every time you're out on the road 
And whenever I'm doing a show 
That I'm your main chick who got that game chick
One and the same chick - the one you can hang with
I ain't never had nobody show me all the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby
That's what you told me and I believe it
'Cause I ain't neva had nobody do me like you
Okay, when you hit the mall, pop tags spend a few G's
Hit the runway to a new season
It ain't nothin', I spoil the one I care for
Feel like I ain't doin' enough, that's when I shared more
I give you dis, give you dat, what you need, love?
You know I got it holla at me if you need love
And affection 'cause I'll be your protection
Kinda hard job, but I do it to perfection
And you can tell that I ain't tryna let you go
I get wit you when I can, so that's how I let you know
And you be trippin' 'cause sometimes I gotta go
But you the first one I holla to right after my shows
And I was trippin' in a sense, I was tense
But my body loose around you, what I'ma do without you
I gotta get it together, say whatever
But since I met you, my life seem so better
I ain't never had nobody show me all the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby
That's what you told me and I believe it
'Cause I ain't neva had nobody do me like you
I ain't never had nobody show me all the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby

Yeah , Frankie J, obsession
Well, it's early in the morning
And my heart is feeling lonely
Just thinkin' 'bout you, baby, got me twisted in the head
And I don't know how to take it
But it's driving me so crazy
I don't know if it's right
I'm tossin', turning in my bed
Well it's five o'clock in the morning and I still can't sleep
Thinkin' 'bout your beauty, it makes me weak
I'm feeling hopeless in my home
I don't know what to do
I think I'm in love, baby

What am I doing wrong?
Amor, no es amor 
Is this an illusion  that I have in my heart?
Now, I know you're not my lady but I'm tryna make this right
I don't know what to do, I'm goin' out of my mind
So baby if you let me, kick it wit' you, then well maybe
We could ride together, we could do this all night
Now I don't care if you got a man
Baby, I wish you'd understand
'Cause I know he can't love you right , quite like I can
Well it's five o'clock in the morning and I still can't sleep
Thinkin' 'bout your beauty, it makes me weak
I'm feeling hopeless at home
I don't know what to do
I think I'm in love, baby

It's an obsession
Hold up, let me dream
Shorty got me feelin' serene
You're my candies and my cream
Got your boy feeling supreme
Hold up, wait a minute
Baby, you so damn independent
Loving everything you representing
Got a lot of money, and I love to spend it
And that's what's up, and I don't care what people scream
You're my blessin' when I'm stressin', my super fly beauty queen
I'ma keep it saucy 'cause mama know how I do
We gon' rendezvous, mi corazón belongs to you

That it wouldn't happen to me 'cause I know how to put it down

Listen to your heart
There's nothing else you can do

And I don't know why

Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile
The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yeah
They're swept away and nothing is what it seems

When love was wilder than the wind

Lookin' good like a sundae cone

Every time I do, it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?
And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out
And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times
I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Remember the old arcade?
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down
We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel
Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it
If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
Every time I do, it makes me"

Could've sworn I was dreamin' for her

Don't ask why your rapper close or man'll get fed
Talkin' tough when your just some beg
Violate, you will see your white kicks turn red
Do what I like, don't care what they said
That's fine, all I can team in is two legs
Straight shellin' when I touch booth for revenge
Got too much pain, head gone ment'
Still patterned up 'cause man got sensе
Flows for the ladies, bars for the gеnts
On a lil' heat for an opp boy, head straight, action, no talk, this intent
On smoke for my name, I don't need street cred
Buss on a teller with a baddie, no spread
Talkin' to mind like you been through war
You don't know about war, you just lips up whores

But anyway, gone and drop a number or something
So I can call you later on,on your phone or something
Take you home, and maybe we could bone or something
It's no limits to what we do, cause tonight we cutting, gut busting
I'm digging in your walls something viscious
With your legs to the ceiling, catch a nut someting serious

With your pretty brown skin, like almond joys and kisses

In and out of your jaws, I was beating down your walls
Had your ass breaking laws for a player was the cause
And every time you seen a G you was slipping off your drawers, I recall
I met your ass at the mall, in the fall

With your pretty brown skin, thick thighs and all
135 petite, and your smell is unique
Maybe we can exchange numbers and hook up in the week
Oh, You a freak, I knew it from the first time I saw you
The way you played with your tongue, I knew right then I would call you
So what it is, they call me Super Don from the ville
And I'mma tell you like this, cause a nigga so real, and stay trill
Cause all I wanna do is just drill, with that ass in the air, and the pussy I kill
And I feel, you love to fuck up on a hill
Suck dick from behind, and take nut in your grill
So bitch chill, and shut your mouth just for a second
While I lay this dick down on you just like I'm Teddy

Don't speak unless it's with intelligence like Barack Obama
I'm magniloquent' I express myself in high flown language
If you catch me slipping I apologize' for not displaying greatness
Baby I'm about to blow
Now is not the time for games or jokes
I need some music I can bob my head to when I'm broke
Need a woman' I need a woman' that bitch not for me
I like the way she look but I don't like the way that she think
I need a J.O.B'
Rather flipping burgers or fifty-packs in the street
You got that fire tree well nigga give me that for my grief
Mama's only son breathing soul bleeding so deep yo throat fill up
I'm here for one reason' to tell you people dont give up
This Scatta G
I'm never gone give up' I promise we gone rise
I know it because I believe in GOD
So I'm going Hard
In this recession praying for blessings
Stressing my message
My way of releasing pain for all this hell I been catching
To all my fathers' Please don't give up
My single mothers' Please' Just don't give up
And all my hustlers' Please don't give up
Silly suckers who don't me
I suggest you leave me lonely
Trying to act hard you phoney
If you want me I'm coming hommie
Cause bitch I'm about to blow
Like the stash pot at the King Pens trap
Haters say I need to grow some fucking more
Well they need to learn how to rap
You can never say I have no love loyalty or respect for the trap
Shit' I ain't even from the way and I put that on the map
Pick yo face up off the pavement'
And ask them women about me'
Bet they say I hit slow'
Shit' they love me'
Because bitch I'm me like Brisco
Don't judge me'
Unless you feel the pain in my pit too'
Disgusting'
A horror movie'
This just the preview
Don't make me meet you treat you then leave you where you lay for trying to play with me
I'm prisoner of my own pain'
Can you define slavery'
I'm education to the streets'
Yall since-less when yall hating me'
This name this fame this brain this pain this game
This what yall gave to me
I'm a soul survivor like Young Jeezy and Akon on a nigga
I got my own problems' never had the nerve to hate another nigga
I'd rather display my love loyalty and respect on a track with them
Never ignorant getting goals accomplished' It's an acronym
I've been sacrificing to get a job' believe it or not
Me and the music go together like a plant and a pot
Life s crazy I've had enough' but never had enough of gripping the guap
So don't hate me if you fuck around and catch me kicking a rock
Baby I'm about to blow'
I can't rush God's work because he in control
All of my ladies' you got to hold on to your love like Envogue
Stay strong for the men who out they mind' Don't let them lose they soul
Rather he work a nine to five or he move that blow
If he provide, respect him and let him know
He the man around this motherfucker
Who real enough to catch a cold get sick break down the dro and roll one up separate
Give you yo own blunt because I don't want you catching shit
Some education and common since is what you better get
So proud every time I turn on my TV and see my president
Black beautiful and rich' with an even richer personality
I'm talking Barack Obama'
I'm talking about Scatta G
I'm talking about Michael Jordan
I'm talking about Michael Jackson
I'm talking about Missy Elliot Young Lloyd and Nelly
And my music make haters feel so worthless'
They gone site down and do some soul searching'
Eliminate the hate'
I'm a doctor on the track' a cold surgeon'
I'll kill you niggas with my old verses'
Ask me to demonstrate'
No' No'
You don't deserve to see royalty when we rock and roll
And you don't wanna see me when I got a knot to cop a Glock
Because I won't hesitate to make it cock back and explode
In yo motherfucking face' Bitch'
So find yo little ass somebody else to play wit'
Because I'll sit back' watch you get started and finished'
Six feet up under the village'
Before I get a chance to say shit'
Tell me who really handling business'
And turn everything secondary until business get finished
Never thought I would meet someone who would have to serve their life in prison'
Somebody snitchin'
Which makes it appropriate enough for me to mention'
Im 22 with no kids'
I guess I just don't look good enough for the bitches'
I love a woman that can move me'
Sooth me'
And in any situation she keep it groovy'
Little black cutie'

Especially at Wet Willie's on Miami Beach
But I drop you off and pay you no attention

Then jump in the car and just ride for hours
Makin' sure I don't miss the homecoming at Howard

And lotion three quarters of his body
Please say, ""Put your hands down""

If you are dancin' on the dancefloor
And you look to your left and your right
And there is not a woman in sight
Guess what? You guessed it - you are not pimpin'

That's because you didn't order Vodka buddy
That's why it's three dollars a glass, a-put your hands down

 Lay it on me girl

Shes gonna
Gimme gimme some
She put it right there on my tongue 
Right there on my tongue 
And gimme some of your butter pecan
Put it right there on tip of my tongue, hold it
Right jeeeah
Cuz baby, if I bite you
I bet you like it
French Vanilla's a hell of a flavor for me
With strawberries, two cherries and whipped cream
The best things are the wet dreams
And uh, the rest is just a flick without a sex scene
Or lee, I speak the truth
Cuz the blacker the berry
The sweeter the juice
Cuz, Florida oranges and Georgia peaches
When they nice and ripe, they the best for eatin'
Southern boys we crave for old slice of pie after they main course
So if you game for it
I came for it
I got a thing for ya
That I can't ignore
She put that sugar on my tongue
Shes gonna
Gimme gimme some

Lookin at me like I'm something to eat

Just to taste my jar of honey
Cotton candy sweet as whoa
Come and lick my Tootsie Roll
My sugar baby once you wet it
Give high blood pressure like a diabetic
How 'bout a little Kim with ya coffee
I just can't keep these boys off me
Pink diamonds, dudes love to frost me
Runnin' behind me like I'm Mr. Softie 
He said I drive 'em crazy
Got a sweet tooth for you baby

Yippie Yippie, Yum Yum
Goodie goodie gum drop
Put me in a tongue lock
Did it 'til my body went numb, numb
Laid her on her back, back
Turned her round, gave her bottom a smack, smack
She's a woman from the block with the best of weed
But I won't stop 'til I'm pullin out tracks, tracks
It was lust at first sight
And she couldn't help sayin that she wanted to get with me
And my size was just right
Cuz she wanted a man with a little sec-ur-ity
Said I been around the world twice
And my name ring bells from Atlanta to Sic-i-ly
Said she wanted it all night
So put the bubbles in the tub and Ludacris and me
She put that sugar on my tongue
Shes gonna
Gimme gimme some
She put it right there on my tongue 
Right there on my tongue 
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeeeah Yeeeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah
Sweetie you look so incredible
So delicious and so damn edible
All I need is some honey or syrup
With a lil' butter to rub down all your curves
And no need for the lemonade
Just a twist of lime and some grape Kool-Aid
Can I call you Caramel?
Cuz I'm bout to go coo-coo to taste your Coco Puffs
One bowl ought to fill me up
But that milk gotta be cold enough
So supper time that'll hold me up
I might choke myself if I don't slow it up, but
Honey, you look like a honeydew melon
Or strawberry with the whipped cream filling
Of the top part of the peach cobbler
But uh, the fruit platter ought to do me better

Planets are moving at the speed of light
Climb up, up in the trees

Is a chance you seize
How long am I gonna stand
With my head stuck under the sand?
I'll start before I can stop
Before I see things the right way up
All that noise, and all that sound
All those places I got found 
And birds go flyin' at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flyin' from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand
Ideas that you'll never find
All the inventors could never design
The buildings that you put up
Japan and China all lit up
The sign that I couldn't read
Or a light that I couldn't see
Some things you have to believe
But others are puzzles, puzzling me
All that noise, and all that sound

And birds go flyin' at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flyin' from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand
Oh, when you see it, then you'll understand
All those signs, I knew what they meant
Some things you can invent
Some get made, and some get sent

But hey
What Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me
Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's wit' you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears, Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright
Heh, it's funny
I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot
So Mama moved back on to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV
And Mama didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh, Mama's only gone for the moment
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright
And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat,
 
don't fuck with Dad

She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else
I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times
But somehow, I want more
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
Tap on my window, knock on my door, I
Want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
Doesn't matter anymore
It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah
My heart is full and my door's always open
You come any time you want, yeah
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
I know where you hide
Alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me  catch her every time she falls, yeah
Tap on my window, knock on my door, I
Want to make you feel beautiful
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye"

Don't look no farther!
Baby im back 
Im here to cater to you 
Cause Ill be your lover 
Ill be your best friend
Tell me what I gotta do 
Now im back in a flesh
Feelin so blessed, back in your corner suga, suga don't stress
Forget about the rest; let's go inside, im back in your zone
Baby im back in your vibe, now I can't be denied I can lie im on ya
I never ever wanna say sayonara
Some body told me that the grass was greener
On the other side of lake haewa
Never really used to be a mean to cheat her
What I gotta do to be a keeper
These words comin out the speaker, true love is off the meter
I was gone for a minute but now im home
Kids forget me for being a rolling stone
Please forgive me let me polish it up like chrome
Get off the phone till he swears to leave me alone
Let my start your interest, now there's no more dating on the internet
Cause you already know how I get it wet, how I get it so salty and I get respect
You don't have to look no farter, you dealin with the hoe with your lada
You don't have to look no farther, you hotter then a fire starter
I was gone for a minute,  x3
Now im back let me hit it  x3
 x2"

And I'm known to be a real nasty man
And they say a closed mouth don't get fed
So, I don't mind askin' for head
You heard what I said, we need to make our way to the bed
You can start using your head
You like to fuck, have ya legs open all in the buck
Toot it up, slapping ass, gurl the sex get rough
Switch position and let the dick get down to business

You wanna skeet-skeet, you 'bout to get your feelings hurt
'Cause I beat that cat with a dog
And knock the walls off a broad till she squall

On the floor, she ain't stealing 'cause she nut, so they crack

Woo!
Bring 'em out, bring 'em out, bring 'em out, bring 'em out
It's hard to yell when the bar-rel's in your mouth 
 
Bring 'em out, bring 'em out 
Bring 'em out, bring 'em out 
 
Bring 'em out, bring 'em out 
 
T-I-P, coming live from the V.I.P
Heard the nightlife lost life without me
Both the feds and the state wanna see bout me
The whole city got biz-zerk, he got three
That other nigga got a hit, but shawty, he not me 
Who set the city on fire as soon as he got freed
The King back now, hoes don't even know how to act now
Hit the club, strippers getting naked 'fore I sat down
Still balling, money stack taller than Shaq now
Still push a button to let the roof on the 'Lac down
I'm on the road, doing shows, putting my mack down
Mississippi to Philly, Albuquerque to Chatt-Town
[Chorus: T.I. & 
Jay-Z

I got the crowd yellin' 
Ayy, all my hot girls yellin' 
Ayy, all the dope boys yellin' 
Ayy, from the back, they yellin' 
Once again, what other rap nigga hood-er than this?
I got rich, and I'm still on some hooligan shit
You be rapping 'bout blow, I was moving the shit
You talking 'bout shooting out, and I was doing the shit
If I hit you in the face, you gon' be suing and shit
And if I catch another case I know I'll truly be missed, so I'ma
Keep a cool head, stay out of the news headline
And show these other rappers it's bedtime 
It's clear to see that I'm ahead of my time
I copped a chromed-out, hard-top Carrera to shine
I got some time, it ain't shit, 'cause I get better with time
Who got a flow and a live show better than mine?
[Chorus: T.I. & 
Jay-Z

I got a packed house yellin' 
Ayy, all my hot girls yellin' 
Ayy, all the dope boys yellin' 
Ayy, from the back, they yellin' 
Uh-y-yeah! Mic check, one-two, one-two
You wanna beef with the King? What is you' gon do?
Will you show up on the scene with two guns drew?
Or you and your friend and play a little two-on-two?
If you knew half of what I knew, then you'd be hitting the deck
I got a tool and a vest—I can get some respect
I'ma make it hard for a sucker nigga to flex
Show thim this ain't the squad for a nigga to test
Pimp, my nuts too large, and we way too fresh
Work well with nines, AK's, and Tecs
And quick to check a lame like a game of chess
You wanna beef, nigga? Bring your best

I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break

Were you born to resist
Or be abused?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Are you gone and on to someone new?
I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use
I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again
But I break loose
My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?

I just broke down 
Baby, if I ever get the chance to be with you again
I would sacrifice
'Cause the feeling that I feel within
No other man would ever make me feel so right
It's nice to smile when I get your phone call at night
But I'd rather have you here with me, right next to me
I miss the way you hold me tight
I gotta let you know I feel so weak without your touch
I never thought that I could ever love a man so much
I gotta let you know I think that we are destiny
For you, I'd cross the world
For you, I'd do anything

Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in, a soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

When we love
The stars light up, the wrong becomes undone 
Naturally, my soul surrenders

When the storm blows your way

Every bit of air you're breathin' in, a soothin' wind

When minutes turn to days and years
If mountains fall, I'll still be here
Holding you until the day I die
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows you away
I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from

I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk

I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me

I watched you die, in your sleep

I was too young for you to lean on me

Caught me by surprise when he called my name
He was a familiar face
From a chapter in my past
Talked for a while
Asked him how it's been
Said that he was seeing somebody and
Told me this was gonna last
Showing me her photograph
And all the feelings that I thought were gone
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself
I never got over you
Wish I was standing in her shoes
And when it's all said and done
Guess I’m still in love with you
I never should have let you go
And it's killing me cuz now I know
And when it's all said and done
Guess I’m still in love with you
We reminisce on the way things used to be
Shared a couple laughs, shared some memories
Talked about the things that changed
Some for good and some for bad
Then he said good-bye
And he paid for lunch
Promised that we'd always keep in touch
Grabbed my bags and grabbed my thoughts
Walked away and that was that
And all the feelings that I thought were gone
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself
I never got over you

Get back, motherfucker, you don't know me like that!

I hit 'em right dead in the jaw (

See, I caught 'em with a right hook, caught 'em with a jab
Caught 'em with an uppercut, kicked 'em in his ass
Sent him on his way 'cause I ain't for that talk!
No trips to the county, I ain't for that walk!
We split like two pins at the end of a lane
We'll knock out your spotlight and put an end to your vain
Put a DTP pendant at the end of yo' chain
Then put the booty of a Swisha at the end of a flame
Yeek yeek!  why you all in my ear?
Talking a whole bunch of shit that I ain't trying to hear!
Get back, motherfucker, you don't know me like that!
Yeek yeek!  I ain't playing around!
Make one false move, I'll take ya down
Get back, motherfucker, you don't know me like that!
Hey! You want what with me?!
I'mma tell you one time, don't fuck with me!
Get down! 'Cause I ain't got nothing to lose
And I'm having a bad day, don't make me take it out on you!
You want what with me?!
I'mma tell you one time, don't fuck with me!
Get down! 'Cause I ain't got nothing to lose
And I'm having a bad day, don't make me take it out on you!
Man! 'Cause I don't wanna do that
I want to have a good time and enjoy my Jack
Sit back and watch the women get drunk as hell
So I can wake up in the morning with a story to tell
I know it's been a lil while since I been out the house!
But now I'm here, you wanna stand around running your mouth?!
I can't hear nothing you saying or spitting, so wassup!
Don't you see we in the club?! Man, shut the fuck up!!
Yeek yeek!  why you all in my ear?
Talking a whole bunch of shit that I ain't trying to hear!
Get back, motherfucker, you don't know me like that!
Yeek yeek!  I ain't playing around!
Make one false move, I'll take ya down
Get back, motherfucker, you don't know me like that!

Borealis what up
Intro:X2
I don’t know what to do
I’m so stuck I don’t know what to do
I don’t even know what to do
I’m so stuck I don’t know what to do
Verse 1:
Let’s get it rolling 
Get this party rolling 
Just wait
I can’t even eat this food that’s up on my plate
Going to sleep hungry by choice no mistake
Can you relate?
People starving and I’m depriving myself
Wonder what’s it gonna take for me to get pride in myself
Whoa, all these loads off are gonna take its toll
Weight loss, weight gain, it’s just outta control
Ain’t talking 50 Cent
You know my mob ain’t deep
My remix isn’t even fresh out of the kitchen
Anticipating when you will cross me
Hoping that you’ll off me
Gun to my head then all i see is red, yeah
What, I can’t talk about depression?
I get it you’re perfect just for the record
Give it to me I’ll wreck it
No lie just expect it
All this pain in my heart is why I’m so reckless, I’m reckless
I’m reckless..
Hook:
Iso-lation 
I just can’t take it 
How will I make it 
Just wait 
Tell me how I get here in the first place 
I don’t wanna be alone but yet I want my space 
I want all that glory but I can’t step up to the plate 
Steps no trace, I trip no lace, substrate Two-Faced
I’m so stuck
I don’t even know what to do 
I’m so stuck
Yeah, what do I do? 
Verse 2:
Here we go
Feeling high, then we’re feeling low
Looking down, looking to the sky
This that merry-go
Let me go, I don’t know
Cereal killer
I don’t want any cheerios
I backstab for kicks
Lately I reminisce; I didn’t steal that kiss
It’s gone now
Talk to me I’m alone now
I’m a mack through text
Kiss me through the phone
Stories of your duress
How I pressured you
Does anyone even have a clue?
What you told me when I was inside of you?
Well I made you say it
No rape I ain’t in to all of that
Consensual, eventual seduction
Gotta get her blushing
All math
Subtract the clothes, add the bed
Divide the legs and pray you don’t multiply
Plan B for the main C gotta lie yeah 
Push deep, get these killstreaks on my life yeah 
Hook:
Iso-lation 
I just can’t take it 
How will I make it 
Just wait 
Tell me how I get here in the first place 
I don’t wanna be alone but yet I want my space 
I want all that glory but I can’t step up to the plate 
Steps no trace, I trip no lace, substrate Two-Faced
I’m so stuck
I don’t even know what to do 
I’m so stuck
Yeah, what do I do? 
Verse 3:
Why do we gotta keep going through this situation
Why can’t you find one girl to keep embracing
Mommy issues, wasn’t nurtured so you gotta find the ones that miss you
Gotta go and find the ones that keep running to the tissues
Watching all them shows with the NiCu’s
Baby’s and boo’s isn’t it true
That you’ve had multiple pairs of eyes looking at you
Then you’re all surprised when they get somebody besides you
They are your teammate not your madre
And a lot of them couldn’t even do that right
You couldn’t lead so they didn’t act right
Wanted somebody that’s not gay
Yet you masturbate to girls kissing
Hypocrite, missing the point i’ll say
Hitting that girl that’s from the Brush
She’s giving you that octane
Gassing you up
You ain’t giving a what
Who, you, where to go? Listen to you
How, why these goodbyes?
You ain’t fixing what’s on the inside yeah
Hook:
Iso-lation 
I just can’t take it 
How will I make it 
Just wait 
Tell me how I get here in the first place 
I don’t wanna be alone but yet I want my space 
I want all that glory but I can’t step up to the plate 
Steps no trace, I trip no lace, substrate Two-Faced

The combination: D-E-F
It's who I am, it's what I do 
And I was gonna lay it down for you
I try to focus my attention
But I feel so A-D-D
I need some help, some inspiration 
 Tryna find the magic
 Tryna write a classic 
Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know? 
Wastebin full of paper 
Clever rhymes, see ya later
These words are my own
From my heart flow 
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way
To better say
I love you, I love you, I love you 
Read some Byron, Shelley, and Keats
Recited it over a hip-hop beat
I'm having trouble saying what I mean 
With dead poets and drum machines
You know I had some studio time booked
But I couldn't find the killa hook
Now you've gone and raised the bar right up
Nothing I write is ever good enough
These words are my own 
From my heart flow 
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way 
To better say 
I love you, I love you, I love you 
These words are my own 
From my heart flow 
 I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you 
There's no other way 
To better say
I love you, I love you, I love you
I'm gettin' off my stage
The curtains pull away
No hyperbole to hide behind
My naked soul exposes 
Whoa, oh
Whoa, whoa
 Tryna find the magic
 Tryna write a classic 
Wastebin full of paper
Clever rhymes, see you later
These words are my own 
From my heart flow 
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way

Standing just a little too close to me

You're sipping just a little too slow for me

Got me thinking what is it you do for me?
Tripping  a little more than I should be
So let yourself go and get right with me

Where all of the walls all continually change
And I've done all I can
To stand on the steps with my heart in my hand
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me
Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
Oh, you see that skin?
It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left
Cleaning up the mess he made
So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
Boys, you can break
You find out how much they can take
Boys will be strong
And boys soldier on
But boys would be gone without warmth from
A woman's good, good heart
On behalf of every man
Looking out for every girl
You are the God and the weight of her world
So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
So mothers be good to your daughters, too
So mothers be good to your daughters, too"

Meet my twin sister Betty Lou
And we're both feeling kinda wild tonight
You're the only cowboy in this place
And if you're up for a rodeo
I'll put a big Texas smile on your face""
I said, ""Girls,""
I ain't as good as I once was
I got a few years on me now
But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really lay it down
And if you need some love tonight
Then I might have just enough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was
I still hang out with my best friend Dave
I've known him since we were kids at school
Last night he had a few shots
Got in a tight spot hustling a game of pool
With a couple of redneck boys
One great big bad biker man
I heard David yell across the room
""Hey buddy, how 'bout a helping hand?""
I said, ""Dave,""
I ain't as good as I once was
My, how the years have flown
But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really hold my own
But if you wanna fight tonight
Guess those boys don't look all that tough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was
I used to be hell on wheels
Back when I was a younger man
Now my body says, ""You can't do this boy""
But my pride says, ""Oh, yes you can""
I ain't as good as I once was
That's just the cold hard truth
I still throw a few back, talk a little smack
When I'm feeling bullet proof
So don't double dog dare me now
Cause I'd have to call your bluff
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was
May not be good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was"

Ooh, two things I don't like when I tryin' to get my groove
Is a partner that meets me only halfway and just can't prove
Take me out so deep when you know you can't swim
Need a lifeguard and I need protection
To put it on me deep in the right direction
Do you understand the facts that I'm tryin' to give to you?
You movin' so slow like you just don't have a clue
Didn't mama teach you to give affection?
I know the difference from a man and an adolescent
It ain't you, boo, so get to steppin'

Girl, I'm in love with you
But this ain't the honeymoon
We're past the infatuation phase
We're right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
It seems like we argue every day
I know I misbehaved
And you've made your mistakes
And we both still got room left to grow
And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work
But I think we should take it slow
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
This ain't a movie, no
No fairytale conclusion, y'all
It gets more confusin' every day, oh
Sometimes it's Heaven sent
Then we head back to Hell again
We kiss, then we make up on the way
I hang up, you call
We rise and we fall
And we feel like just walkin' away
As our love advances
We take second chances
Though it's not a fantasy
I still want you to stay
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, yeah, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow
Maybe we'll live and learn
Maybe we'll crash and burn
Maybe you'll stay, maybe you'll leave, maybe you'll return
Maybe another fight
Maybe we won't survive
Maybe we'll grow, we'll never know
Baby, you and I
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go, yeah, hey
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow, hey, hey
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow

I'm packin' heat with the .45 magnum in my belt
Shawty lookin' so fine, wish I could've felt
When I drugged the bitch, the drug I could've melt
I'm feelin' so fine in the back of my Hummer
Ridin' down a main street, I'm stuntin' like a winner
I've been in the running for a long time
I feel it's safe to say that DPalm can bust a bomb rhyme
When I write down a verse, there ain't no controversy
Look at your bitch, she's fifteen, call that statutory
Smokin' on Arabian shit, don't you know? the good stuff
The smoke hit the back of your throat, the shit is rough
Told you suckers, DPalm gonna murder this investigation
Who's the next bad rapper? Turnin' on a mutilator
Fry you bitches up in, what is called frialator
I worked at fast food, don't fuck with what I'm sayin'
I don't wanna be the next rapper on TV
I just wanna be me, enough about succeeding
Smokin' spliffs and we be hittin' that Mauwie Wowie shit
Drinkin 'til we daze-y, knockin' back down shots of Bacardi
Parental advisory stickers all over my merchandise
Like I was gonna put a ""Fuck you"" in front of my merchants' eyes
Who the fuck is Dana Carvey? I'm the master of disguise
Get as high as I am right now, and you'll be clappin' in the skies
Don't be foolish, that plot's kinda like the flick ""Mission: Impossible""
Your homeboy's sayin' shit that got me actin' kinda pausible
 That's A.K.A. for actin' gay
Concoct your own acronym for ""Prez is gonna spray""
Best believe me, I'll do it, my words are the truest
And I will throw some shit that leaves you lyin' in your fluids
Young Money co-signer, please free Weezy
So we can be broadcast live, like cable TV
I'm new to this league, but great like John Wall
We be burnin', Sean Paul, hard to kill, Steven Seagal
We goin' in, like a robber, hide your toddler
Windows we smash 'em, TVs we grab 'em, don't holler
No problems, solutions we got 'em
Melt your head off in layers, like a human Gobstopper
Orville poppin', Smith & Wes Glockin'
And we treat red lights like bed nights, and we ain't stoppin'"

Strange as it seems
She's the one I'm after
'Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself
I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery

She's just the girl I'm lookin' for
She can't keep a secret

The more I adore her

On her caller ID
She won't pick up the phone
She'd rather be alone
But I can't give up just yet
'Cause every word she's ever said
Is still ringin' in my head
Still ringin' in my head
She's cold and she's cruel
But she knows what she's doin'
Knows just what to say
So my whole day is ruined

Dawg, she got me
Got me doin' things I'll never do
If you ain't been I'm tellin' you
I'm sprung 
Dawg, she got me
Got me doin' things I'll never do
If you ain't been I'm tellin' you
You do 
You do 
You do

You do 
Ooh
She got me doin' the dishes
Anything she want for some kisses
I'm cookin' for her when she gets hungry
All she doin' is actin' like she want me
She cuttin' off all my homies
Even all my other ronis
She ain't even my main lady
See I been thinkin' bout it lately
Man she really don't deserve me
All she wanna do is hurt me
So I gotta get away from her
But now I'm leaving quickly
Before she come and try to get me
And I'm takin' everything with me
Well it all come down to her
I'm sprung
Dawg, she got me
Got me doin' things I'll never do
If you ain't been I'm tellin' you
I'm sprung 
Dawg, she got me
Got me doin' things I'll never do
If you ain't been I'm tellin' you
You do 
You do 
You do 
You do 
You do 
You do 
You do 
So we went our separate ways
It's been a couple of days
But now I'm doin' what I want to
With nobody tellin' me what I'm gon' do
And I'm feelin' so free
With nobody but me
Now I can handle all my business
All of my fellas, can I get a witness?
But I'm feelin' kinda lonely
On top of that I'm kinda horny
And I gotta get back to her
Now I'm leavin' quickly
Before she come and try to get me
And I'm takin' everything with me
Well it all come down to her
I'm sprung
Dawg, she got me
Got me doin' things I'll never do
If you ain't been I'm tellin' you
I'm sprung 
Dawg, she got me
Got me doin' things I'll never do
If you ain't been I'm tellin' you
You do 
You do 
You do 
You do 
You do 
You do 
Ooh
She got me doin', what I won't do
Got me sprung and I told you
You don't agree with me
In the end you'll see that
She got you doin', what you won't do
Now you're sprung and I told you
S-P-R-U-N-G
Now you see, she
Got you
Got you
Got you
Got you
She got you
Got you
Got you
Got you"
96,"""Chariot""",Gavin DeGraw,https://genius.com/Gavin-degraw-chariot-lyrics,"Staring at a maple leaf
Leaning on the mother tree
I said to myself, ""We all lost touch""
Your favorite fruit is chocolate covered cherries
And seedless watermelon, oh
Nothing from the ground is good enough
Body rise
Look what's over me
Oh chariot, your golden waves
Are walking down upon this face
Oh chariot, I'm singing out loud
To guide me
Give me your strength
Remember seeking moon's rebirth
Rains made mirrors of the earth
The sun was just yellow energy
If it's a living promise land
Even over fields of sand
Seasons fill my mind and
Cover me
Bringing back
More than a memory
Oh chariot, your golden waves
Are walking down upon this face
Oh chariot, I'm singing out loud
To guide me
Give me your strength
You'll be my vacation away from this place
You know what I want
Holding that cup
It's pouring over the sides
Make me wanna spread my arms and fly
Oh chariot, your golden waves
Are walking down upon this face
Oh chariot, I'm singing out loud
To guide me
Give me your strength
Give me your strength 
Give me your strength 
Give me your strength 
Give me your strength 
Give me your strength 
Give me your strength 
Give me your strength 
Give me your strength, oh chariot"

Uh, 112 
Uh, 
 Oh baba-ba-baby
F to the O  B double O 
G to the S 
S-E-X 
You already know that I like it hardcore
I'm from Brooklyn, you can leave ya Timberlands on
Creep like a Grem-i-lin, I'm a late night broad 
Soon as you turn ya brake lights off I'mma work you right off
Brown nigga, what
You already know I turn around nigga  what
Tonight's your night girl 
I'm trynin' to give you that thing to make you say 
From the kitchen floor down to the fire place 
Insense burning, your body's talking that shit to me
Cancel that phone 
The only sound I'm tryin' to hear is your moan 
You ridin' topless, no panties on 
And I've been thinkin' 'bout this all day long
You're giving me the fire though..
Papa coming home, like to give you that raw
Favorite position, from the back door
Girl you know the drill don't ask no questions, you already know
Is your girl Jenny home 
Call her up and tell her it's 'bout to be on 
Tell her don't show if it ain't heels and thongs 
I can already see it, ooh what a feeling
Just don't 
Get jealous if I hit that to hard 
Cuz you come first
You know your my heart 
Cuz it'll always be your's, girl I'm 'bout to turn you out
Papa coming home, like to give you that raw
Favorite position, from the back door
Girl you know the drill don't ask no questions, you already know
You know just how I like it to see it
You know just how I like beat it, you already know
You know I like to go down and eat it
And you know I won't stop until you get it, you already know
You already know, brain game I got it
Plus I cut like I trained Lorraine Bobbit
Fox got box to brings rings out ya pocket
Like a cell phone is in there
When you in here, feel like you in the air
Nothin' can compare 'cept for like you in the Lear...jet
Yes, we're takin' off
Buckle ya seat belts, nigga ya need help
F-O-X, male in distress
Thought you could put it on me, only except he never factored
Me throwin' it back-backwards
Back shots on the back of the matress
I can fake it like an actress if you want me to
Or I can wine it like Passion, that's what I wanna do
Tell a ball player dude he can slide on true
Check one, one two, come on
Check one, one two 
Papa coming home, like to give you that raw
Favorite position, from the back door
Girl you know the drill don't ask no questions, you already know"
98,"""Mississippi Girl""",Faith Hill,https://genius.com/Faith-hill-mississippi-girl-lyrics,"Yeah
Well, it's a 
long way
 from 
Star, Mississippi
To the big stage I'm singin' on tonight
And sometimes the butterflies still get me
When I'm in the spotlight
And some people seem to think that I've changed
That I'm different than I was back then
But in my soul, I know that I'm the same way
That I've really always been
'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big-headed from a little bit of fame
I still like wearing my old ball cap
Ride my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around the world
But y'all, I'm still a Mississippi girl 
Well, I spent a few weeks in California
They put my face on the big movie screen
But that don't mean I've forgotten where I came from
That's just me chasin' dreams, yeah
'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big-headed from a little bit of fame
I still like wearing my old ball cap
Ride my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around the world
Y'all, I'm still Mississippi girl 
'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big-headed from a little bit of fame
I still like wearing my old ball cap
Ride my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around this world, that's alright
'Cause y'all, I'm still Mississippi girl

Oh

Mississippi girl, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh

 Back again! 
Luda!
Hahahaha 
It gets meaner and meaner each time, baby
Feeling real good, too 
What up, Uncle 'Face?
 
Haha, haha
I'm a bull in this industry, man 
Some would rather run down and get one cow 
I think I'd rather walk down and get 'em all—you know what I'm talking 'bout, right? 
Look—
I'm never going nowhere, so don't try me
My music sticks in fans' veins like an IV
Flows poison like Ivy—oh, they grimy!
Already offers on my sixth album from labels tryna sign me
Respected highly; Hi, Mr. O'Reilly!
Hope all is well—kiss the plaintiff and the wifey
Drove through the window, the industry super sized me
Now, the girls see me and a river's what they cry me
I'm on the rise, so many people despise me
Got party ammunition for those tryna surprise me 
It's a celebration, and everyone should invite me
Roll with the crew or meet the bottom of our Nikes 
Explorer like Dora—these Swipers can't swipe me
My whole aura's so mean in my white tee
Nobody light-skinned'ed repping harder since Ice-T
You disagree, take the Tyson approach and bite me!
Whoa! Don't slip up or get got 
I'm coming for that number-one spot
 
Rappers swearing they on top 
But I'm coming for they number-one spot 
Scheme-scheme, plot-plot 
I'm coming for that number-one spot! 
Keep it going—it won't stop 
I'm coming for that number-one spot
Yes, indeed! Ludacris: I'm hotter than Nevada
Ready to break the steering column on your Impala
If I get caught, bail-out; po'-po'—I tell 'em, ""Holla""
In court, I never show up, like Austin Powers' fa-zha
""Father, father,"" and hey, I love gold
But can buy anything I want from the records I've sold
Jacuzzi's hot, Cristal is so cold
Neighbors catch contacts from the blunts that I've rolled
A pig in a blanket, a shmoke and a pancake
Drop albums nonstop, once a year for my fans' sake
I crush mics until my hand breaks
Then shag now and shag later
 
'til these women can't stand straight
The Luda-meister got 'em feeling so randy
I'm double-X-L, so I call 'em my ""eye candy""
Brush my shoulder and I pop my collar
'Cause I'm worth a million gazillion fafillion dollars
Whoa! Don't slip up or get got 
I'm coming for that number-one spot
 
Rappers swearing they on top 
But I'm coming for they number-one spot 
Scheme-scheme, plot-plot 
I'm coming for that number-one spot! 
Keep it going—it won't stop 
I'm coming for that number-one spot
Causing lyrical disasters, it's the master
Make music for Mini-Mes, models and Fat Bastards
These women trying to get me out my Pelle Pelles
They strip off my clothes and tell me, ""Get in my belly!""
Stay on the track, hit the ground running like Flo-Jo
Sent back in time, and I've never lost my mojo
Ladies and gentlemen, ahh, boys and girls
Ludacris sent down to take over the whole world
Whoa! Don't slip up or get got 
I'm coming for that number-one spot
 
Rappers swearing they on top 
But I'm coming for they number-one spot 
Scheme-scheme, plot-plot 
I'm coming for that number-one spot! 
Keep it going—it won't stop 
I'm coming for that number-one spot"

You got me feeling that you dig me
Boo I'm digging you too
You wanna be one of the chosen few

Sit you in a crib where you can chill
Don't have to move a muscle
Give you some be good now you be good
Daddy gon hustle
Come here let me Whisper in your ear
I gotta tell you something
Listening to this song kinda make a nigga want something
Did some daydreaming
Now I'm fiending like I'm on something
Girl don't hold it from me
Cause right now I'll be don strong on ya
I ain't the type to ruin your life
By running game and throwing your dreams
Get in your brain suit your game
Ease your pain and show you things
Sit you on some leather seats while blowing green
And switching lanes
Girl stop playing games let me beat it out the frame
Girl give me that pussy
Girl give me that
Girl give me girl give me that there
She five foot seven a hundred and thirty nine pounds
Thirty six twenty four thirty eight pretty fine brown
Bad lil broad I ain't seen her in a minute
Since the All-Star game and I'm still tryin to hit it
Got a baby for this nigga that I used to sell things
He caught a fed case and he ain't leave her no change
She sold all his jewels she sold all his cars
Now she dancing in the shaker club stripping for the stars
Sliding down the pole slow drop it to a split
Pussy popping on a handstand man she the shit
She still looking tight though
Still built right though
Run my game right and after the club
She might go back to the telly with me
Shake her jelly with me
Let my people bust on her face and her belly with me
I got Lil Webbie with me and he ain't hating
We some players in this bitch so baby stop hesitating
Girl give me that pussy
Girl give me that
Girl give me girl give me that there
Now I can tell from your size that that pussy is fire
So I'm here and willing to give you whatever it require
For you to lay down on your back and then open your thighs
Long sharp deep and wide have you rolling your eyes
You a big fine horse I had no choice but to try it
Look like it's worth a couple g's but ain't some shit I buy
Let me whisper in your ear again I ain't gon lie
I might share a lil meal just don't tell nobody
Look you know you want it
Girl don't act like you don't want it
Girl you want it just as bad as I do
But check this out
You gon be wishing that you been gave me your money
By the time I finish rumbling with you
While rhymes get loose let's take this shit to the room
And you just keep yourself excited til we get to the room
Cuz I've been rocked up since I met you
I'm ready to give you the blues
Don't stunt now take off your shoes
Don't act confused you know what time it is
Girl give me that pussy
Girl give me that
Girl give me girl give me that there"
