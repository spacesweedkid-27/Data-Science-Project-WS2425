Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a—
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Usually, I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

2,"""As It Was""",Harry Styles,https://genius.com/Harry-styles-as-it-was-lyrics,"Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you
Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same
Answer the phone
""Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?""
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same
Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
Leave America, two kids follow her
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first
As it was
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was"

That I've been washin' my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me
There ain't no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I've tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up
Go easy on mе, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel thе world around me
Had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me
I had good intentions
And the highest hopes
But I know right now
It probably doesn't even show
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
I didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me"

Spendin' his, mine in the bank

A boss like you need a boss like me 
Daddy from the street, so he move lowkey
Tryna rock that mic' like karaoke

Can't skip foreplay, kill the pussy cold case

If you ever see me broke, I'm probably rockin' a cast
Pretty face, no waist with a big ol' bag, ha

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lеad to you
Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space

An afro, black boy with the gold teeth
With dark skin, lookin' at me like he know me
I wonder if he got the G or the B
Let me find out and see, comin' over to me, yeah
These days, I'm way too lonely
I'm missing out, I know
These days, I'm way too alone
And I'm known for givin' love away, but
I want someone to love mе
I need someone who needs me
'Causе it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me and my dreams
So I want someone to love
That's what I fuckin' want
Look, you know it's harder to find in these times
But I got nothin' but love on my mind 
I need a baby with love in my prime
Need an adversary to my ""down and weary""
Like, tell me ""That's life"" when I'm stressin' at night
Be like, ""You'll be okay"" and, ""Everything is alright,"" uh
Let me in that thing, 'cause I'm not wanting anything
But your loving, your body, and a little bit of your brain
These days, I'm way too lonely
I'm missing out, I know
These days, I'm way too alone
And I'm known for givin' love away, but
I want someone to love me
I need someone who needs me

For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground

When my back is to the world that was smilin' when I turned
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y
My enemy-y-y-y-y 
But I'm ready
Your words up on thе wall as you're prayin' for my fall
And the laughter in thе halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind, and I'm waitin' for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us

I'm prayin' that somebody hope for me
I'm stayin' where nobody 'posed to be p-p-posted
Being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em, ""Hasta luego""
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc
On an opposition, kinda shockin' they wanted static
With precision, I'm automatic quarterback
I ain't talkin' sackin', pack it
Pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up
Who the baddest? It don't matter 'cause we at your throat
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy 
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Oh, the misery 
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy 
Everybody wants to be my enemy

I don't clear up rumors , where's y'all sense of humor? 
I'm done makin' jokes 'cause they got old like baby boomers
Turned my haters to consumers, I make vets feel like they juniors 
Say your time is comin' soon, but just like Oklahoma 
Mine is comin' sooner , I'm just a late bloomer 
I didn't peak in high school, I'm still out here gettin' cuter 
All these social networks and computers
Got these pussies walkin' 'round like they ain't losers

But see how deep the bullet lies 
Unaware, I'm tearin' you asunder 
Oh, there is thunder in our hearts 
Is there so much hate for the ones we love? 
Oh, tell me, we both matter, don't we?

Oh, come on, baby 
Oh, come on, darlin' 
Let me steal this moment from you now
Oh, come on, angel
Come on, come on, darlin'
Let's exchange the experience 
And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places

Be runnin' up that hill
With no problems

And the world, it feels too big
Like a floating ball that's bound to break
Snap my psyche like a twig
And I just wanna see
If you feel the same as me
Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?
Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die
Like you're hangin' by a thread but you gotta survive
'Cause you gotta survive
Like your body's in the room but you're not really there
Like you have empathy inside but you don't really care
Like you're fresh outta love but it's been in the air
Am I past repair?
A little bit tired of trying to care when I don't
A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope
A little bit tired of sinkin', there's water in my boat
I'm barely breathin', tryna stay afloat
So I got these quick repairs to cope
Guess I'm just broken and broke
The prescription's on its way
With a name I can't pronounce
And the dose I gotta take
Boy, I wish that I could count

If this could make me happy

'Cause, man, you never know
If you got a chance take it
Take it while you got a chance
If you got a dream chase it

If you're gonna love somebody
Hold 'em as long and as strong and as close as you can

'Cause if I say I miss you, I know that you won't

Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home
I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
There's orange dancin' in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancin', this wood used to creak
To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

Please turn those headlights around

Turned somethin' to nothin', bruh, I'm livin' proof
How can I lose when we the who's who's?
Still runnin' 'round with Mohawk, jet ready, pack the Goyard
People probably think I show off, I ain't even give it yet
Runnin' up a silly check, stayin' off the internet
Share the stage with Billie Eilish, turnt at any given time
Personal partners pillow talkin' 'cause I got rich without 'em
Only thing they should be sayin' is, ""Baby keep it solid""
We ain't even deep as we used to be, this shit slick, divided
Bruh ain't got no hustle or nothin', so he gon' stick to violence
I be known to run down, I'm dialed in, so I can't speak about it
She know I'm a gangster, she love me, I bring the freak up out her
Can't play with me, you know I come trim, I'm in a different league
I'm tired of showin' what I can get done, what you gon' do for me?
Forty-thousand miles up in the air, only time I get some Z's
Full-court press, foot on they neck, and I can't let 'em breathe
Blood, sweat, and tears come with this check, it ain't nowhere near easy
Had to fall back, you know how that go, we only speakin' briefly
Hope I'm not too much to handle, city nigga from Atlanta
I spent my last check on ammo, this is not a regular Lambo
Hundred thousand dollars kit, could've put down on another Lambo
Don't be in the mix, I built this shit forever havin' say so
This shit gon' get serious about my money, this ain't no fuckin' Play-Doh
Brodie down for double homicide, I try to tell him, ""Lay low""
C don't like to drive, but he spin good, I'm on the way to Clayco
AK-47s in the spots before they made the Draco
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal
Overbuying cars, I snatch the Brabus just for motivation
Shootout at the spot today, tomorrow, we in a new location
Free all of the guys, I hope y'all beat the case or get probation
Stash it at my mama house, four hundred bands in the ventilation
Now look how I'm living, I bought a house for the money to stay at
Right when niggas think that I got soft, I'ma pull up and spray at
Living like a don, might smoke a blunt in the back of the Maybach
Pull up like your mama with the switch, ""Why the fuck would you say that?”
You can do it first, I'ma do it worst, gotta double the pay back Never take it personal, show no mercy, bruh taught me that way back
Condo to get off, I was always taught, ""Don't tell hoes where you stay at""
Keep a stash house, you can't take nothing to the spot where you lay at
Never be a bother, if you off me, no problem, just say that
Never runnin' off, so if I owe you, I got you, I'll pay that
Give this shit my all, so when I'm old, I can chill and just lay back
Really from the bottom so the trenches is where I feel safe at
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal

Girl, I want you like you want me too
I feel that energy 
When you're on top of me 
I know your man, he ain't controllin' you
But you still hesitate 
'Cause you choose loyalty 
And I know your history 
Met him before your peak 
He's so connected to that woman that you used to be
But-but-but this sex will cloud your memory
A couple strokes to put it in, then you'll belong to me
[Pre-Chorus: Doja Cat & 
The Weeknd
]
I got a man, but I want you
I got a man, but I want you (
Oh
)
And it's just nerves, it's just dick
Makin' me think 'bout someone new
You know I got so much to say
I try to hide it in my face
And it don't work, you see through
That I just wanna get with you
 
And you're right
You right, I 
Got my guy 
But I, I 
Can't help it, I want you
Said you right, I 
Got my guy 
But I, I 
Can't help it, I want you"

I was out with the boys, catchin' up in a neon light
Didn't know 'til we walked in it was karaoke night
She was in a circle of girls, chasin' a shot with a lime
She was laughin', they were darin' her to get on the mic
One of 'em walked up and turned in her name
Next thing I knew, man, she was up on the stage, singin'
""Heads Carolina, tails California""
Maybe she'd fall for a boy from South Georgia
She's got the bar in the palm of her hand
And she's a '90s country fan like I am
Hey, I got a Chevy, she can flip a quarter
I'd drive hеr anywhere from herе to California
When this song is over, I gotta find her
'Cause she had me at ""Heads Carolina""
Yeah, she knew every word by heart, didn't need no screen, no
I was raisin' my glass up for her, I saw her smilin' at me, yeah
She had me down in the front by the end of verse two
Like there wasn't no one else in the room, we were singin'
""Heads Carolina, tails California""
Maybe she'd fall for a boy from South Georgia
She's got the bar in the palm of her hand
And she's a '90s country fan like I am
Hey, I got a Chevy, she can flip a quarter
I'd drive her anywhere from here to California
When this song is over, I gotta find her
'Cause she had me at ""Heads Carolina""
Yeah, I bought her a round and we talked 'til the lights came on
I still see that girl every time I hear that song
""Heads Carolina, tails California""

She's got the bar in the palm of her hand
And she's a '90s country fan like I am

He was sitting out back in a rocker
He said ""What you been up to lately?""
I told him chasing a dollar
And in between sips of coffee
He poured this wisdom out
Said ""If you want my two cents on making a dollar count
Buy dirt
Find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love but call it work
And throw a little money in the plate at church
Send your prayers up and your roots down deep
Add a few limbs to your family tree
And watch their pencils marks
, and the grass in the yard
All grow up
'Cause the truth about it is it all goes by real quick
You can't buy happiness
But you can buy dirt""
Before you get caught on that ladder
Let me tell you what it's all about
Find you a few things that matter
That you can put a fence around
And then he laid it out
Buy dirt
Find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love but call it work
And throw a little money in the plate at church
Send you prayers up and your roots down deep
And add a few limbs to your family tree
And watch their pencils marks, and the grass in the yard
All grow up
'Cause the truth about it is it all goes by real quick
You can't buy happiness

Does he laugh the way I did?
Is this a part of your story?

I'm not nervous
I'm as tough as the crust of the Earth is
I move mountains,
 
I move churches
And I glow 'cause I know what my worth is
I don't ask how hard the work is
Got a rough, indestructible surface
Diamonds and platinum,
 
I find 'em, I flatten 'em
I take what I'm handed, I break what's demanded, but
Under the surface
I feel berserk as a tightrope walker in a three-ring circus
Under the surface
Was Hercules ever like, ""Yo, I don't wanna fight Cerberus""?
Under the surface
I'm pretty surе I'm worthless if I can't be of servicе
A flaw or a crack, the straw in the stack
That breaks the camel's back, what breaks the camel's back? It's
Pressure like a drip, drip, drip that'll never stop, woah
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'til you just go pop, woah, oh, oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's older
Give her all the heavy things we can't shoulder
Who am I if I can't run with the ball?
If I fall to
Pressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won't let go, woah
Pressure like a tick, tick, tick 'til it's ready to blow, woah, oh, oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's stronger
See if she can hang on a little longer
Who am I if I can't carry it all?
If I falter
Under the surface
I hide my nerves, and it worsens, I worry somethin' is gonna hurt us
Under the surface
The ship doesn't swerve, has it heard how big the iceberg is?
Under the surface
I think about my purpose,
 
can I somehow preserve this?
Line up the dominoes,
 
a light wind blows
You try to stop it topplin', but on and on it goes
But wait
If I could shake
The crushing weight
Of expectations, would that free some room up for joy
Or relaxation?
Or simple pleasure?
Instead, we measure
This growing pressure
Keeps growing, keep going
'Cause all we know is
Pressure like a drip, drip, drip that'll never stop, woah
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'til you just go pop, woah, oh, oh
Give it to your sister, it doesn't hurt, and
See if she can handle every family burden
Watch as she buckles and bends but never breaks
No mistakes, just
Pressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won't let go, woah
Pressure like a tick, tick, tick 'til it's ready to blow, woah, oh, oh
Give it to your sister and never wonder
If the same pressure would've pulled you under
Who am I if I don't have what it takes?
No cracks,
 
no breaks
No mistakes, no pressure"

We held hands and waded into
That blue water, she left her flip-flops
By my

Yeah, but now I'm dodgin' potholes
In my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado
Headed right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissеd me
Tells me shе'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me
Was some sand in my boots
I said, ""Let's go shoot tequila""
So, we walked back to that beach bar
She said, ""Don't cowboys drink whiskey?"" 
So, we drank bottom shelf
She said, ""Damn, that sky looks perfect""
I said, ""Girl, you've never seen stars
Like the ones back home""
And she said, ""Maybe I should, see 'em for myself""

Yeah, but I still thought that maybe she'd show up
Aw, but now I'm dodgin' potholes

Red dirt makes good-riding roads
Country makes good music
For kicking up dust in a taillight glow
Dry wood makes good fires
Goodyears make good swings
All that's all good, but for me
God makes 
five-foot-nine
, brown eyes in a sundress
Loves Tim McGraw and a small-town accent
Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love
Jack makes good whiskey, but God makes the good stuff
Oh, God makes the good stuff
Like that sweet little kiss she lays on me
When I pull up in the gravel drive
The way she dances with the raindrops
Like she's the reason why they fall from the sky
And I thank Him every time I close my eyes
God makes 
five-foot-nine
, brown eyes in a sundress
Loves Tim McGraw and a small-town accent
Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love
Jack makes good whiskey, but God makes 
the good stuff
God made her, so I'ma make sure
He didn't waste an angel on me
When He made five-foot-nine, brown eyes in a sundress
Loves Tim McGraw and a small-town accent
Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love

It ain't broke yet, but damn, it needs fixin’
Been a while since your kiss felt like kissin'
It's just different
We've been talkin' 'bout forever since we been together
Somethin' 'bout a ring makes you think we’re better
Off with all this, but we’re caught in-between
A rock and a hard place
Red wine and mistakes
Tears rollin' down your face
When I walked out that door
That’s when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn, I'm 
exhausted
What the hell's this all for?
Is this where it mеnds or it breaks?
Between a rock and a hard place
For thе record 
Throwin' in the towel takes some effort
So I’d rather ride it out for better weather
Together
Between a rock and a hard place
Red wine and mistakes
Tears rollin' down your face
When I walked out that door
That's when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn, I'm exhausted
What the hell's this all for?
Is this where it mends or it breaks?

What the hell's this all for?
Is this where it mends or it breaks?
How much more of this can we take?"

""What was growing up like?""
""Where'd you go to school?""
""And what would you do if you weren't doin' this?""
I'd be drivin' my first car, an old worn-out Dodge
Tryin' to make rent with a dead-end job, just makin' due
With tips in a jar, my guitar, and an old barstool
I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand
Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band
Singin' them same damn songs like I am now
I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage
Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins
At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town
I'd still be doin' this if I weren't doin' this
I'd still be the same guy they knew back in the day
Who was burnin' CD's just to give away
Payin' his dues
If I wasn't doin' this
Five deep in a van, head full of steam
Hot on the heels of my neon dreams maybe comin' true
Livin' this life just like I was born to do
I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand
Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band
Singin' them same damn songs like I am now
I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage
Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins
At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town
I'd still be doin' this if I weren't doin' this
It ain't about the fame
It ain't about the fortune
It ain't about the name
It ain't about the glory
I guess I'm sayin' it's always been about
I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand
Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band
Singin' them same damn songs like I am now
I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage

I'll be so much stronger
I'll stay up for longer
Meet me at our spot
Caught a vibe 
Baby, are you coming for the ride? 
I just wanna look into your eyes 
I just wanna stay for the night, night, night
When we take a drive 
Maybe we can hit the 405
Hypnotized by the lights
Man, this must be the life

When I go to sleep, I can't even fall asleep
Something's got ahold of me
Feel it taking over me
But when I'm older I'll be moving onward
I just got a drunk text
(
Meet me at our spot

We caught a vibe 
Baby, are you coming for the ride? 
When I look into your eyes 
I just wanna hold you all night 
Maybe we can take a drive 
Baby, we can hit the 405
Hypnotized by the lights
Man, this must be the life
Meet me at our spot
Got something I wanna show you
Meet me at our spot
They can't find us there
Meet me at our spot
Got something I wanna show you
Meet me at our spot
They can't find us there

Watched my favorite shows on your TV
Made me breakfast in the mornin'
When you got home from work
Makin' plans to travel 'round the world
Said we'd always put each other first
Old love songs we used to play to
Funny, now I hate you
Now, I
Remember when you'd call me late at night
I gave you my hours and advice just tryna fix you
And all your daddy issues
But now, I don't even miss you anymore
So, I
I want all the tears back that I cried
All the hours spent givin' advice on how to write your songs
All you did was prove me wrong
When you said you loved me
Well, you must've had your fingers crossed
Shoulda paid attention to my friends
Tellin' me how bad it's gonna end
Always givin' their opinions
Now I wish I would have listened
I could say I'm sorry, but I'm not
You don't deserve the one thing that you lost
Now, I
Remember when you'd call me late at night
And I gave you my hours and advice just tryna fix you
And all your daddy issues
But now, I don't even miss you anymore
So, I
I want all the tears back that I cried
All the hours spent givin' advice on how to write your songs
All you did was prove me wrong
When you said you loved me
Well, you must've had your fingers crossed
 Your fingers crossed
 Your fingers crossed
 
Oh, when you said you loved me
Well, you must've had your fingers crossed

But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah
And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well"

Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later, we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling
You will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear
Voices singing, ""Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly""
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancin' merrily
In the new old-fashioned way
You will get a sentimental feeling

2 AM at a Broadway bar
She's puttin’ her number in my phone (
Broadway girls alone
)
Two Bud Lights deep, and she's sayin' things she don’t mean
And you know
I met her down at Aldean's
She said that she saw me walkin' in about a mile away
Bean just had to take her phone and that just took her smile away
She said I'm too drunk and crazy, she don't like the way I dance
I said, ""You don't have to join in,"" she said she'd take a chance
I've been kinda crazy ever since it went down
I get kind of lost, and, baby, this what I found
Girls like you just wanna take me around, around and around
[Chorus: Morgan Wallen & 
Lil Durk
]
Oh, there’s two things that you’re gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I’da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone (
Leave 'em alone, leave 'em alone
)
Them Broadway girls alone (
Leave 'em alone, leave ’em alone
)
Leave them Broadway girls alone
They town just told me, ""Don't trust 'em""
Broadway girls a trap
They on me, they tryna finesse me
They see me with Morgan and know that I rap
My horse is Porsches, turnin' me on
I jump on a horse, she get on the back
I went to the bar to go buy her a drink
She listen to P!nk, she told me she not into rap
I can't run out of money
The trenches love me forever
They treat me like Ed in London
Take her to pool, then got a beer for nothin'
Tecovas boots, guitar, cigar, the bar
She ridin' a bull like cars, she usually don't cool with stars
Now, there's two things that you're gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone

Them Broadway girls alone

Oh yeah, I'm finna make a banger with this one
Last time you told me you proud of me, you wasn't proud of me, you was the nigga who doubted me
I was too mad at you, you let 'em come kill you, my brother, that shit was a tragedy
But magically, I got the strategy, I was so sick and tired of niggas keep asking me
""Who was the killers between the hood?"" (
DJ on the beat, so it's a banger
)
Bro, I'm a king, that mean we good
Talked to my tete about my problems
Learned to survive, I carry my chopper
Before I was twelve, I went to the doctor
Fucked on a stripper and I took me a Roxy
How you my blood and you say you gon' pop me?
Fall over loyalty, never 'bout thotties
Don't mention my name if you mentionin' bodies
Don't mention my name if you mentionin' bodies
Stopped taking drugs, had to sit in a sauna
How you gon' blame me? I gave her Gabbana
Bitch, I'm a star, gotta use condom
Don't drink Par, only like Wocka
Sippin' on Wocka, I feel like I'm Flocka
Shit in my pocket, that shit'll go blocka
Say that I'm mean, what you mean? I caught you
Get away from her, high speed, no tossin'
Called you a bitch, I'm sorry I lost you
Head down, X pill, Percocet, off it
Bitch, my phone died, pass me a charger
Ain't have a coat, walked to school in a thermal
Bitches you lookin' up to, they'll burn you
Get out my business, that shit don't concern you
I get to diggin' this shit when I learn you
I love the trenches, this shit is eternal
Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?
I wish my brother had made it out surgery
I be up thinkin', that shit do be hurtin' me
If they gon' catch me, them niggas gon' murder me 
Gave my bro twenty, he caught for a burglary
I love the bitches who say they ain't heard of me
Ever seen blood? That shit'll turn burgundy
Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?
Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?
Fresh like the first day of school, I'm a scholar
Found the solution and got some more problems
We from the sandbox, my dawg since a toddler
Sixteen years old when I shot my first chopper
Flew out of Van Nuys, landed in Opa-locka
Quit flyin' in G5, fly helicopters 
I count every blessin', they count every dollar
I'm 'bout to go factory plain
I treat all of my dawgs the same
Take care all of my bitches the same
I just hope you financially sane
Never turning my back on the gang
From the A, we was taught to be brave
Had to squabble and take a few fades
Stay rock solid, you'll get through the phase
Damn my nigga, what happened to Virgil?
Talked to God, I don't wanna get murdered
I got style, I don't know what you heard of
You lil' pussy, you soft and fertile
Only real ones throughout my circle
Only real ones throughout my circle, oh
R.I.P. Prince, I'ma pour up some purple
600 Maybach, the one with the curtain
Young GunnaWunna, the boy bought the Birkin
I'm goin' hard, know you proud of me workin'
Ridin' round the town sippin' and swervin'
Hold it down, do this shit with a purpose
Louis down, man, this shit came from Virgil
Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?
Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?
Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?"

We're so young, boy, we ain't got nothin' to lose, oh-oh

All my bitches feel like I dodged the county
Fuckin' with you feel like jail, nigga 
I can't even exhale, nigga 
Pussy like holy grail, you know that 
You gon' make me need bail, you know that
Caught dippin' with your friend
You ain't even half, man, lyin' on your ****, you know that
Got me a bag full of brick, you know that

Probably will for the rest of my life

My heart gets broke in half
But do I wish I could get her back?

The other day right out of the 
Blue Clear Sky
You came on in my truck
I couldn't turn it off fast enough
I tried to get back in the game

In her dad's new car
You tell me I shouldn't stress out
Say, ""It's not that hard""
But I just got a feeling
This will leave an ugly scar
If you say, ""She's nothing to worry about""

Stupid boy making me so sad
Didn't think you could change this fast
She's got everything that I don't have
How could I ever compete with that?
I know you'll go and change your mind
One day wake up and be bored with mine
She's got everything that I don't havе
And she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be so bad, so bad
Shе's got everything that I don't have, hm-mm
You want someone you can show off
Whenever you go out
She'll wear a tight mini black dress
With all her friends around
And then you'll probably spend the night at
Her nice big house
And by then I'll just be someone
You've forgotten about, oh

I showed up to the new apartment
First month's, last month's, two deposits
Hadn't heard the sound of a door slam yet
Thank God I was an optimist
I drove circles around this town
Tryna write circles around this town
Tryin' to say somethin' with meanin'
Somethin' worth singin' about
I've been kind and I've been ruthless
Yeah, I got here, but the truth is
Thought when I hit it, it'd all look different
But I still got the pedal down
Drivin' circles around this town
So many times, I thought about lеavin'
Got my ass kicked tryin' to compete with
Evеrybody else's ones that got away
Hung around long enough to catch a break
A couple hundred songs and the ones that finally worked
Was the one about a car and the one about a church
That I wrote
Drivin' circles around this town
Tryna write circles around this town
Tryin' to say somethin' with meanin'
Somethin' worth singin' about
