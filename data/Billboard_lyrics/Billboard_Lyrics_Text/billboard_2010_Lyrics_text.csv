Wake up in the mornin' feelin' like P. Diddy
 
(
Hey, what up, girl?
)
Grab my glasses, I'm out the door, I'm gonna hit this city
 
(
Let's go
)
Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't comin' back
I'm talkin' pedicure on our toes, toes
Tryin' on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowin' up our phones, phones
Drop-toppin', playin' our favorite CDs
Pullin' up to the parties
Tryna get a little bit tipsy
Don't stop, make it pop, DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight 'til we see the sunlight
Tick-tock on the clock, but the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, woah, oh 
Oh, woah, woah, oh
Don't stop, make it pop, DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight 'til we see the sunlight
Tick-tock on the clock, but the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, woah, oh 
Oh, woah, woah, oh
Ain't got a care in the world, but got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here
And now the dudes are linin' up 'cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger
I'm talkin' 'bout everybody gettin' crunk 
Boys try to touch my junk 
Gonna smack him if he gettin' too drunk, drunk
Now, now we go until they kick us out 
Or the police shut us down, down
Police shut us down, down, po-po shut us (
Dow—

Don't stop, make it pop, DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight 'til we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock, but the party don't stop, no

My heart, it pounds, yeah, you got me
With my hands up, you got me now
You got that sound, yeah, you got me 
 You build me up, you break me down
My heart, it pounds, yeah, you got me 
With my hands up, put your hands up, put your hands up
Now, the party don't start 'til I walk in

""Hey, sorry I missed your call, just leave a message after the beep""
""Hey, yeah, it's me, just been thinking about everything tonight
And I don't know, I just miss you so much
Give me a call back if you can?""
Picture-perfect memories scattered all around the floor
Reachin' for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time
It's a quarter after 1, I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now
Another shot of whiskey, can't stop lookin' at the door
Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before
[Pre-Chorus: Charles Kelley & Hillary Scott, 
Charles Kelley
]
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time
It's a quarter after 1, I'm a little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now
Woah, oh
I guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothin' at all

Your lipstick stains
On the front lobe of my left-side brains

The smell of you in every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided
You're the one I have decided who's one of my kind
Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
Tonight
Hey, hey, hey
Just in time
I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me
You gave my life direction
A game show love connection we can't deny
I'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
I believe in you, like a virgin, you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind
Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
Tonight
The way you can cut a rug
Watching you's the only drug I need
So gangster, I'm so thug
You're the only one I'm dreaming of, you see
I can be myself now, finally
In fact, there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you'll be with me
Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know

Airplanes in the night sky are like
Shooting stars? I could really use a
Wish right now, wish right now
Wish right now

Yeah

I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you starin' at that phone in your lap
And you hopin', but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravellin', they're sayin'
""What would you wish for if you had one chance?""
So airplane, airplane, sorry, I'm late
I'm on my way, so don't close that gate
If I don't make that, then I switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night

Somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job, before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah, back when I was tryna get a tip at Subway
And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it
But, nowadays, we rappin' to stay relevant
I'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes outta airplanes
Then maybe, oh, maybe I'll go back to the days 
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listen to my mixtape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur
—
what's up, Bobby Ray?
So, can I get a wish to end the politics? (
Oh

And get back to the music that started this shit?
So here I stand, and then again, I say
I'm hopin' we can make some wishes out of airplanes

Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, 
I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna—
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie"

B.o.B
]
Beautiful girls all over the world
I could be chasin', but my time would be wasted
They got nothin' on you, baby
Nothin' on you, baby
They might say ""Hi"", and I might say ""Hey""
But you shouldn't worry about what they say
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby
(
Yeah
) Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby
Na—nothin' on you, ha!
Yeah
I know you feel where I'm comin' from 
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done 
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun 
On the carousel, so around I spun 
With no directions, just tryna get some 
Tryna chase skirts, livin' in the summer sun 
And so I lost more than I had ever won 
And honestly, I ended up with none 
There's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinkin' maybe I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant, but I was wonderin'
If there was somethin' that you wanna know 
But never mind that, we should let it go 
'Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode 
And all the bad thoughts, just let 'em go
[Chorus: Bruno Mars & 
B.o.B

Hands down, there will never be another one 
I been around and I never seen another one 
Because your style, they ain't really got nothin' on 
And you wild when you ain't got nothin' on 
Baby, you the whole package, plus you pay your taxes 
And you keep it real while them others stay plastic 
You're my Wonder Woman, call me Mr. Fantastic 
Stop, now think about it
I've been to London , I've been to Paris 
Even way out there to Tokyo 
Back home down in Georgia  to New Orleans 
But you always steal the show 
And just like that, girl, you got me froze 
Like a Nintendo 64 
If you never knew, well, now you know

Uh, she got that good-good, she Michael Jackson bad
I'm attracted to her, or her attractive ass
And now we murderers, because we kill time
I knock her lights out and she still shine
I hate to see her go but I love to watch her leave
But I keep her running back and forth; soccer team
Cold as a winter's day, hot as a summer's eve
Young Money thieves steal your love and leave
I like the way you walking if you walking my way
I'm that Red Bull, now let's fly away
Let's buy a place, with all kind of space
I'll let you be the judge, and-and-and I'm the case
I'm Gudda Gudda, I put her under
I see me with her, no Stevie Wonder
She don't ever wonder, 'cause she know she bad
And I got her, nigga: grocery bag

He pressing me like button-downs on a Friday night
I'm so pretty like, be on my pedal bike
Be on my low starch, be on my egg whites
He say, ""Nicki don't stop, you the bestest""
And I'd just be coming off the top, asbestos
I love your sushi roll, hotter than wasabi
I race for your love, ""Shake'n Bake"" Ricky Bobby
I'm at the W, but I can't meet you in the lobby
Girl, I gotta watch my back, 'cause I'm not just anybody
I seen em stand in line just to get beside her
I let her see the Aston and let the rest surprise her
That's when we disappear, you need GPS to find her
Oh, that was your girl? I thought I recognized her
Ooh baby, I be stuck to you like glue, baby
Wanna spend it all on you, baby

Call me Mr. Flintstone, I can make your bed rock

 I-I-I-I can make your bed rock
 I-I-I-I can make your bed rock 
She like tanning, I like staying in
She like romance and I like rolling with friends
She said I'm caged in, I think her conscience is
She's watching that Oxygen, I'm watching ESPN
But when that show ends, she all over my skin, lotion
Slow-mo motions, rollercoastin'
Like back, forth, hold it
She poses like it's for posters and I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you for me, she said: ""Don't you ever show this!""
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it, said ""Your words get me open""
So I closed it, where your clothes is?
I'm only loving for the moment
She ain't got a man, but she's not alone
Miss Independent, yeah, she got her own
Hey gorgeous, um, I mean flawless, well
That's what you are, how I see it is how I call it, yeah
Look-look at how she walk, m-hmm, she know she bad
Do-do your thang baby, I ain't even mad
And I ain’t leavin' fast, I'ma stay awhile
Hold your head, Chris, I-I'ma take it down!
Ooh baby, I be stuck to you like glue, baby

And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me
You got your high brow, switch in your walk
And you don't even look when you pass by
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise, shh
See, I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Girl, you're so vain, you probably think that
This song is about you, don't you?
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me
Now don't you dare act like you don't know 
Know what's up , 'cause your nose is up
I'm approachin' up, pshht, yup
Like I can give you winter in the summer
Or summer in the winter, Miami in December
Tryna look bored in them Dior 
She probably is
Was actin' shallow 'til she found out how deep that my pockets is
Mrs. Primadonna, this is your reminder
That I think you fine, but I'm finer
Sean, yup
'Cause it sure seems you got no doubts
But we all see you got your head in the clouds
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me"

They overdosing on my swag
Put the whole god damn hood in rehab
Too many rumples in my duffle
Can't close this bag its so much cash
I need 10 hands now to count my stash
LL Cool Gucci Mane I'm back
Never need a mask best check my stash
You must be hall-u-cin-a-tin
1st day out girl ain't you glad?
6 supermodels crashing at my pad
I should be a model drinking outta gold bottles
With some tru religion jeans sagging off my ass
Please don't crash am I goin' to fast
Touchdown anywhere I don't need no pass
Might need some gum cause I'm finna talk trash
Cuz keep em on task like a kid at class
Hater can't hit what a hater can't see
Untouchable these haters sure can't see me
He wouldn't know a hit if you hit him in the head
With a 4 by 4 standing 6 foot 3
Ready for a bitch, crocodile dun sheet
Never met a girl I ain't fuck first week
You never seem a g throw a 10,000 white mink
On the floor live on B.E.T 
I only got life I can live
There's only so much game I can give
So you could watch the show chillin' at your crib
And weeks turn to months, and months turn to years
But I be smoking dro, Ima fuck some hoes
Ima ball today, wake up, then go ball some more
Can't tell a grown man what to do with his
It's your prerogative Ima mind my biz
But Ima live the life, forever rocking ice
Throwing money popping bottles cause that's just what I like
Verse 2:
Screaming I'mma be like the Black Eyed Peas
I wanna be free and you wanna be me
Best eased if you really want beef
Ima fight you by the trees looking like swiss cheese
Just came home ain't thinking bout sleep
Bitch ya favorite rapper ain't slept in weeks
Thinkin' bout me like I'm down the street
Know it's over soon as my feet touch concrete
Pull up in South Beach blowing on trees
Whipping down the street like I'm riding on D's
A new ferrari flying down Peachtree
Girl I might roll ya window down Gucci Mane please
Make sure 2010 I'm free,fall off in the booth like 1017
Before I'm through fire jumping out the roof but we dont need water please bring more weed
Niggas can't win now they wanna switch teams, can't entertain that by no means
You wanna get on nigga chase your dreams,stop chasing me down like a dope fiend
Starting off my day with an M-16, shit ain't been the same since I turned 16
My whole life changed, now it's so icy
1st album on the charts came out same week 
Verse 3:
My auntie had a stroke and she still can't speak, wrote me every week real talk thats deep
Ex-cell mate gotta 35 piece, won't be released till 2033
It's my son's birthday my boy turned 3, and looking at him is like looking at me
Can't look back and watch the moves I make
But the moves that I made fuck around and move me"

Mami took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
""Hail Mary"" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life

Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shiny lights

A different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire
Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes, like, ""Here, lady, have this""
And last but not least, grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the ho-ho
Aha, get it?
I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Everywhere I go, I'ma have my own theme music

 for when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh, when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh 
I be playing basketball with the president
Dunking on his delegates
Then I compliment him on his political etiquette 
Toss a couple milli' in the air just for the heck of it 
But keep the fives, twennies, tens, and bens completely separate 
And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up 
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks 
And not a single tummy around me
Would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream 
Go in your pocket, pull out your wallet
And put it in the air and sing

Yeah
 
It's been a ride
 
I guess I had to
 
Go to that place to get to this one
 
Now some of you
 
Might still be in that place
 If you're tryna get out
 Just follow me, I'll get you there
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it
I don't give a damn what you think, I'm doin' this for me
So fuck the world,
 
feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From 
Infinite
 down to the last 
Relapse
 album
He's still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
 
like a ""Fuck you"" for Christmas
His gift is a curse,
 
forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings, instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last 
Relapse
 CD was ""ehh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road 
And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me, you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye
, I feel like the king of
My world, 
haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar,
 
I'd shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazin', and
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road "

My judgment's gettin' kinda hazy
My steeze is gonna be affected
If I keep it up like a lovesick crackhead
What you've got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time 
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave 
Hey, so I got a question 
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement? 
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum?
Is my love your drug? 
Your drug 
Huh, your drug 
Huh, your drug 
Is my love your drug?
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug 
Your love, your love, your love 
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug 
Your love, your love, your love 
Hey
Hey
So
Your love, your love, your love, your love
Is my drug
I like your beard"

Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air and leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head,
 
a sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems 
Leave my door open just a crack
(
Please take me away from here
)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(
Please take me away from here
)
Why do I tire of counting sheep
(
Please take me away from here
)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep?
To ten million fireflies, I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell 
But I'll know where several are if my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar 
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems 
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems 
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Because my dreams are bursting at the seams"

Smelling like Dolce & Gabbana

And if you like it, baby, we can take it to the condo
And if you like the condo, we can move the party to the bedroom
I'ma beat your body like a congo

She can go lower than I ever really thought she could
Face down, 
ass up
The top of your booty jiggling out your jeans
Baby, pull your pants up
I like it when I see you do it better than I've ever seen I done before
A lot of women drop it to the ground, but how low can you go?
Lower than your mama's ever seen it in her lifetime
Never would've imagined it, not even in her right mind
Practice in front of that mirror, now you doing it on the dance floor
Mad 'cause I can't get with you, chick, just show me how to dance, oh
I may not wanna get low, so I'm posted up, kinda like a player do
But if you come to the crib, then I might show you girls a thing or two
Yeah, I think you a superstar, with a ass like that you gotta blow

From A-T-L-A-N-T-A and all the way down to yo' block
Put the needle on the record 
and I make her get lower than a Lamborghini
And if she really get low, then I'ma shoot a video and put it all on TV
'Cause I like that French vanilla  and the caramel 
But when it comes to chocolate , I know that very well
Asian persuasion, no discrimination, I love how they seem to please us
I wanna taste them butter Rican pecan peanut butter cups like Reese's Pieces

I've broken my heart so many times, I stopped keeping track
Talk myself in, I talk myself out
I get all worked up, then I let myself down
I tried so very hard not to lose it
I came up with a million excuses
I thought I'd thought of every possibility
And I know some day that it’ll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And I promise you, kid, that I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet
I might have to wait, I'll never give up
I guess it's half timing and the other half's luck
Wherever you are, whenever it's right
You'll come out of nowhere and into my life
And I know that we can be so amazing
And baby, your love is gonna change me
And now I can see every possibility
And somehow, I know that it'll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And promise you, kid, I'll give so much more than I get

They say all’s fair in love and war
But I won’t need to fight it
We'll get it right and we'll be united
And I know that we can be so amazing
And being in your life is gonna change me
And now I can see every single possibility
And someday, I know it'll all turn out
And I'll work to work it out
Promise you, kid, I'll give more than I get

Burning bridges shore to shore

To walk away from something when it's dead
Do-do-do your dirty words
Come out to play when you are hurt?
There's certain things that should be left unsaid
Tick, tick, tick, tick on the watch
And life's too short for me to stop
Oh, baby, your time is running out
I won't let you turn around
And tell me now I'm much too proud

You were in college working part time waitin' tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts
I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now
Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about
Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight, 2:30AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone""
You said, ""I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
 You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter

Sometimes we fall down, can't get back up
We're hiding behind skin that's too tough
How come we don't say ""I love you"" enough?
'Til it's too late
It's not too late
Our hearts are hungry for a food that won't come
And we could make a feast from these crumbs, yeah
And we're all staring down the barrel of a gun
So if your life flashed before you
What would you wish you would've done?
Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given here
If this is all we got, then we gotta start thinking it
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got eighty-six, four-hundred seconds in a day
To turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying, oh
And if your plane fell out of the skies
Who would you call with your last goodbye?
Should be so careful who we let fall out our lives
When we long for absolution
There'll be no one on the line
Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given here
If this is all we got, then we gotta start thinking it
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got eighty-six, four-hundred seconds in a day
To turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying, oh
Like we're dying, ohh, like we're dying
Like we're dying, ohh, like we're dying
We only got eighty-six, four-hundred seconds in a day
To turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying
Yeah
Mmm, you never know a good thing 'til it's gone
You never see a crash 'til it's head on
Why do we think we're right when we're dead wrong?
You never know a good thing 'til it's gone
Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got, then we gotta start thinking
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got eighty-six, four-hundred seconds in a day
To turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying, oh
Like we're dying, ohh, like we're dying

Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad men

Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever? (

Ayy, may the best of your todays be the worst of your tomorrows

Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young

But we ain't even thinkin' that far, ya know what I mean?

So we living life like a video 
Where the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold and the music's always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today 'cause there's no tomorrow
Just a picture-perfect day that last a whole lifetime
And it never ends 'cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine
Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark they can't erase, neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut, I'll be fine
I'm forever young
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young 
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young
Fear not when, fear not why, fear not much while we're alive
Life is for living, not living uptight, 'til you're somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye's
Are not for legends, I'm forever young, my name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves, over Pyrex pots
My name shall be passed down to generations
While debating up in barbershops
Young slung, hung here, showed that a nigga from here
With a little ambition, just what we can become here 
And as the father pass the story down to his son's ears
Young'll get younger every year, yeah
So if you love me, baby, this is how you let me know
Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby
[Chorus: Mr. Hudson &

Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young 
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young

Just let it run

Slamming Bentley doors, hopping outta Porsches
Popping up on Forbes' list, gorgeous 
Niggas thought I lost it, they be talking bullshit
I be talking more shit, they nauseous 
I'll be here forever, you know I'm on my fall shit
And I ain't with foreclosure, I will never forfeit

But according to me
You're stupid, you're useless
You can't do anything right
But according to him
I'm beautiful, incredible
He can't get me out of his head
According to him
I'm funny, irresistible
Everything he ever wanted
Everything is opposite
I don't feel like stopping it
Baby, tell me what I've got to lose
He's into me for everything I'm not
According to you 
According to you 
According to you
I'm stupid
I'm useless
I can't do anything right"

I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do
'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me
Walk in the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that can light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers

Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door

With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess 
Am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a JAY-Z song was on
And a JAY-Z song was on
And a JAY-Z song was on
So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, ""Yeah""
Movin' my hips like, ""Yeah""
I got my hands up, they're playin' my song
I know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A. 
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A. 
Get to the club in my taxi cab
Everybody's lookin' at me now
Like, ""Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks?""
""She gotta be from out of town""
So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on
So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, ""Yeah""
Movin' my hips like, ""Yeah""
I got my hands up, they're playin' my song
I know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.

Feel like hopping on a flight 
Back to my hometown tonight 
Something stops me every time 
The DJ plays my song and I feel alright

I'm noddin' my head like, ""Yeah""

Uh, used to be Valentines, together all the time
Thought it was true love, but you know women lie
It's like I sent my love with a text two times
Call 'cause I care, but I ain't get no reply 
Tryna see eye to eye, but it's like we both blind
Fuck it, let's hit the club, I rarely sip but pour me some
'Cause when it's all said and done
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to
I hate liars, fuck love, I'm tired of tryin'
My heart big, but it beat quiet
I don't never feel like we vibin'
'Cause every time we alone, it's a awkward silence
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And give me back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit, it's over, what you trippin' for?
I don't wanna have to let you go
But, baby, I think it's better if I let you know

Look, my shawty always on some bullshit like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow
The other chick I'm with never complainin'
She make me wanna leave the one I'm with, Usher Raymond
Prolly didn't register, don't trip, later on, it will
Shorty full of drama, like Gangsta Gri-zills
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me
I got a new chick, and she ain't you
She Paula Patton thick, she give me déjà vu
And all that attitude, I don't care about it
But all that shit I do for her, you gon' hear about it
Breezy rep two up, two down
But I'm just puttin' two up, chuckin' up the deuce now

I was careless, I forgot
I did
And now
When all is done, there is nothin' to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won, you can go ahead, tell them
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Fallin' out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worse
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know
Thinking all you need is there
Buildin' faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know, I know
And now
When all is gone, there is nothin' to say
And if you're done with embarrassin' me
On your own, you can go ahead, tell them

But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like a album
Who'da thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches
It may not mean nothin' to y'all

Ayy, ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you could call it statutory
When a nigga blow up, they gon' build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, ""What?"" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
'Member she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull they cameras out and, goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, huh

Fuck no, go for broke,
 
his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes and establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited, you can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains who stand inside of the booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings come flyin' up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback, motherfucker, for the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouths with a bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place, so, Drake
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me

Got no family I can blame
Just don't let me disappear
I'ma tell you everything
So tell me what you want to hear
Something that'll light those ears
I'm sick of all the insincere
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away
This time
Don't need another perfect lie
Don't care if critics ever jump in line
I'm gonna give all my secrets away
So tell me what you want to hear
Something that'll light those ears
I'm sick of all the insincere
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away

Don't need another perfect lie
Don't care if critics ever jump in line
I'm gonna give all my secrets away
All my secrets away

Someone's gotta take the lead tonight
Who's it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here and tell you all that comes to me
If you have somethin' to say, you should say it right now
You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it
I was wonderin', maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
If you ask me, I'm ready 
If you ask me, I'm ready 
I know you said to me
""This is exactly how it should feel when it's meant to be
Time is only wasting, so why wait for eventually?""
If we gon' do somethin' 'bout it, we should do it right now
You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
It is what we make it
I was wonderin', maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy
Or would it be so beautiful?
Either way, I'm sayin'
If you ask me, I'm ready

Why give up before we try?
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away

Keep your hands up, get 'em in the sky for the homies that didn't make it and my folks locked down 
I never went nowhere , but they sayin' ""Luda's back"" 
Blame it on that conjure , the hood call it Luda 'gnac
 
And I'm on this foolish track so I spit my foolish flow 
My hands go up and down , like strippers' booties go 
My verses still be servin' , tight like a million virgins 
Last time on the Khaled remix, now I'm on the original version
 
Can't never count me out , y'all better count me in 
Got twenty bank accounts, accountants count me in 
Make millions every year  the South's champion

Back to back, set a trap, hit the lick, hit it back

But I'm addicted to this life, it's gon' be hard to quit
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along

Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true 
My guilty pleasure, I ain't goin' nowhere
Baby, long as you're here, I'll be floatin' on air, 'cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you 
Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death could make us part
What kind of dream is this?
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you 
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true 
My guilty pleasure, I ain't goin' nowhere
Baby, long as you're here, I'll be floatin' on air, 'cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you 
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you"

There was something in your eyes, and it wasn't right
I should've walked, but I never had the chance
Everything got out of hand, and I let it slide
Now I only have myself to blame
For falling for your stupid games
I wish my life could be the way
It was before I saw your face
You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You had my heart, now, I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

And I never say your name, and I never will
And all your things, well, I threw 'em in the trash
And I'm not even sad
Now you only have yourself to blame
For playing all those stupid games
You're always gonna be the same
Oh no, you'll never change
You stole my happy, you made me cry

Who else is really trying to fuck with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G's bro
Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in two's
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I been sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my B's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
And I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first
Meet me on the fresh train
Yes I'm in the building, you just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jessie James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been flyin' so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spin and dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killer but don't push me
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my B's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first
How do you say what's never said?
Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red
Limping off tour, 'cause I made more off my second leg
Motherfuckin' Birdman Junior, 11th Grade
Ball on automatic start
I can hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
Uh, now come on be my blood donor
Flow so nice you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn where you stumbled at? From where they make Gumbo at
Kane got the fucking beat jumping like a jumping jack
And you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
Hip-Hop, I'm the heart of that
Nigga, nothing short of that
President Carter, Young Money Democrat
Now tell me how you love it

I just had to come back one last time
Ma'am, I know you don't know me from Adam
But these hand prints on the front steps are mine
Up those stairs, in that little back bedroom
Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar
And I bet you didn't know under that live oak
My favorite dog is buried in the yard
I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me
Mama cut out pictures of houses for years
From 'Better Homes and Garden' magazine
Plans were drawn and concrete poured
Nail by nail and board by board
Daddy gave life to Mama's dream
I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me
You leave home, you move on and you do the best you can
I got lost in this whole world and forgot who I am
I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could walk around, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me"

She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh, and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even gray, but she buries her baby

Well, I've had just enough time
If I die young, bury me in satin

Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of man
But it sure felt nice when he was holdin' my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts—oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
Funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Ooh, ooh, the ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em
Oh, the sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

My daddy cry and curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my mama swore that she would
Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist
But, darling, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
Maybe I know somewhere
Deep in my soul that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now, I had sworn
To myself that I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk
Well, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
I've got a tight grip on reality, but I can't
Let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream, oh
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

And for you, you, and you to back it up and dump it
 
Put your arms out front, lean side-to-side 
They gonna be on you when they see you hit that Dougie right
Ain't nobody fuckin' with my bro from Morningside
He go by ""Bubba,"" and he hit that dance like thunder
 
I ain't from Dallas, but I D-Town boogie
I show my moves off now, everybody tryna do me 
I leave the functions, and all the ladies tryna screw me 
Now you just do you, and I'ma do me 
Niggas love to hate, so they try to shoot me
Bitches be stuck to me, I think they try to glue me
I make the party shine bright when it started gloomin'
This beat was bubblegum, so I had to chew it

On a nigga dancin', none of 'em know me
I hear the squad screamin' like, ""Ayy, get it, brodie""
So I move my shoulders and I take it real low
They like ""How he do that? He can Dougie on the floor""
And when that nigga stop, they like ""Dougie some mo'""
I'm like ""A nigga kinda tired,"" then I pass it to the bro
M-Bone, show these cats how to do that
Down South dance that we learned a lil' too fast
And brought it to the hood and got the whole crew ass

But I'm 'bout to escape with a bitch and head home 
She got her friend, so it's a two-man and
I wanna run it even if her legs long 
She like ""You hubby,"" I think she love me
But, I change the subject and I do my Dougie 
'Cause I don't give a fuck, blow trees, get money
Me, Smoove, Heff in the back with Playboy bunnies
We gon' make em do the Dougie in the middle of the bed
And when I asked for some head, this bitch looked at me funny
Dawg, bitch, you can't tell me nothin'
Star made the beat, and I just took it out the oven
I just see the Dougie when everybody clubbin'
And I hate skinny jeans 'cause the burner keep rubbin'

Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Anybody could've told you right from the start
It's 'bout to fall apart
So rather than hold on to a broken dream
I'll just hold on to love
And I could find a way to make it
Don't hold on too tight
I'll make it without you tonight
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Oh, Lord
Have you ever tried...
Without my love
Have you ever tried, have you ever tried?"
100,"""Lover, Lover""",Jerrod Niemann,https://genius.com/Jerrod-niemann-lover-lover-lyrics,"Well the truth
Well it hurts to say
I'm gonna pack up my bags
And I'm gonna go away
I'm gonna split
I can't stand it
I'm gonna give it up and quit
Ain't never comin back
But before I get to goin' I've got to say
I know you used to love me
But that was yesterday
And the truth, I won't fight it
When the love starts burnin you got to do whats right
Woah, lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more
Woah, lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more
Well the truth
Yeah, it hurts to say
I'm gonna pack up my bags
And I'm gonna go away
I'm gonna split
I can't stand it
I'm gonna give it up and quit
Ain't never comin back
But before I get to going
There was a time oh woman
When you used to shake it for me
Now all you do is treat me cold
Ain't gonna take it no more
Gonna walk out the door
Lover, lover, lover
You dont treat me no good no more
No, no, more more more
Woah, lover lover lover
You don't treat me no good no more
Yea, yea, yea
Well I went with you on a starry night
And Im hurtin' too bad cause you dont treat me right
Woman oh woman
You know I love you so
You're just so mean to me baby Im walkin out the door
Lover oh lover
I know you used to love me in every way, but now I'm givin up
And I'm tired of cryin babe
I can't stand it no longer
It hurts me to say
I'm packin up my bags and goin far away
Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me good no more
Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me good no more
Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me good no more
Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me good no more"
