I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Oh, oh
But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said
""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""

To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons

Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well, I got homies
But in the end, it's still so lonely
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?
How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You're bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we wasn't gon' speak so
Why we up 3 a.m. on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me fo'?
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
‘Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months, then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me
In the night, I hear 'em talk 
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?
Talk and talk and talk and talk
Baby, let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got somethin' new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight into the night
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless? 
Oh, how could you be so heartless?
On and on and on and on
And on and, and on and on and on"

With a big smile on my face
And it never feels outta place
And you're still probably workin'
At a 9 to 5 pace
I wonder how bad that tastes
When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
Now where's your picket fence, love?
And where's that shiny car?
And did it ever get you far?
You never seemed so tense, love
I've never seen you fall so hard
Do you know where you are?
And truth be told, I miss you
And truth be told, I'm lyin'
When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell
I hope it gives you hell
Tomorrow, you'll be thinkin' to yourself
""Yeah, where did it all go wrong?""

When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell
Now you'll never see what you've done to me
You can take back your memories, they're no good to me
And here's all your lies, you can look me in the eyes
With the sad, sad look that you wear so well
When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell 
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell 
When you hear this song and you sing along, no, you'll never tell 
Then you're the fool, I'm just as well, hope it gives you hell 
When you hear this song, I hope that it will give you hell
You can sing along, I hope that it puts you through hell"

She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do
'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me
Walk in the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that can light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door

Oh, I've been travelin' on this road too long 
Just tryin' to find my way back home 
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And oh, I've been travelin' on this road too long 
Just tryin' to find my way back home 
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey
Ever had one of them days wish you woulda stayed home
Run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on?
You walk by, they get wrong
You reply, then shit get blown
Way outta proportion, way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one, then rush him
Figure you get jumped, hell, that's nothin'
They don't wanna stop there, now they bustin'
Now you gushin', ambulance rushin' you
To the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus you hit four times, bullet hit yo' spine
Paralyzed waist-down, now you're wheelchair-bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive
Just think, it all started, you fussin' with three guys
Now your pride in the way, but your pride is the way
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day
Niggas die everyday, all over bullshit
Dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit
Could this be ‘cause of hip hop music?
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?
Usually niggas don't know what to do when
Their back against the wall, so they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blow, I guess
From Bankhead up to yo projects
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it, now I take
Time to think before I make
Mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets, I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away

I ain't never been scared, I lived through tragic
 situation
Coulda been dead lookin' back at it
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin'
In apartments, hangin', smokin' and rappin'
Niggas start shit, next thing you know, we cappin'
Get locked up, then didn't even get mad
Now think about, damn, what a life I had!
Most of that shit, look back, just laugh
Some shit, still look back, get sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door
Who'da thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies, I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his jaw, cost me more
I'da took that ass-whoopin' now for sure
Now, think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripes
A nigga put his hands on me, alright
Otherwise, stand there, talk shit all night
'Cause I hit you, and you sue me
I shoot you, get locked up, who? Me?
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it, now I take
Time to think before I make

13,"""You Found Me""",The Fray,https://genius.com/The-fray-you-found-me-lyrics,"I found God
On the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west
Was all but won
We're all alone
Smokin' his last cigarette
I said, ""Where you been?""
He said, ""Ask anything""
Where were you
When everything was fallin' apart?
Where all my days
Were spent by a telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
To the corner of First and Amistad
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me
Well, in the end
Everyone ends up alone
But losin' her
The only one who's ever known
Who I am
Who I'm not, and who I wanna be
No way to know
How long she will be next to me
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me
Early mornin'
The city breaks
But I've been callin'
For years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
You never sent me no letters
You got some kinda nerve
Takin' all I want
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Where were you? Where were you?
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me
Why'd you have to wait
To find me? To find me?"

Keep rockin', and keep knockin'
Whether you Louboutin it up or Reebokin'
You see the hate that they servin' on a platter
So what we gonna have, dessert or 
disaster
?
I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you, my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like I'm in a race, but I already won first place
I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did 
You got me thinking 'bout our life, our house, our kids, yeah
Every morning, I look at you and smile
'Cause, boy, you came around
And you knocked me down, knocked me down
Sometimes, love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes, love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
I never thought I'd hear myself say 
""Y'all go 'head"" 
""I think I'm gonna kick it with my girl today""
I used to be commander-in-chief
On my pimp ship, flyin' high 
'Til I met this pretty little missile 
That shot me out the sky 
Hit, so now, I'm crashin' 
But I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could go back and 
Don't you know I would, baby, if I could?

She shot the bullet that ended that life 
I swear to you, the pimp in me just died tonight

Aye

Ooh, when it knocks you down, oh

Tell me now, can you make it past your Caspers
So we can finally fly off into NASA?
You was always the cheerleader of my dreams
That seemed to only date the head of football teams
And I was the class clown that always kept you laughing
We were never meant to be, baby, we just happened
So, please, don't mess up the trick
""Hey Young World,"" I'm the new Slick Rick
They say I move too quick, but we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess ask someone that's only average for advice?
OMG, you listen to that bitch?
Woe is me, baby, this is tragic
'Cause we had it, we was magic
I was flyin'; now, I'm crashing
This is bad, real bad—Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad—Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'ma ask him
So you gotta take the good with the bad, happy and the sad
Well, will you bring a better future than I had in the past?
Oh, 'cause I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again
 Mmh-mmh, I'll admit it
I was scared to answer love's call
 And if it hits better make it worth the fall
When it comes around, hey

Comes around, whoa
And it knocks you down

When love comes around

And it knocks you down (Eh-eh, 
oh-oh

Won't see it coming when it happens (

'Cause I'm a paper chaser
Just livin' my life  my life 
My life  my life 
Just livin' my life  my life 
My life  my life  just livin' my life
Hey, never mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege, homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still, I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away
You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
So live your life  Ayyy ayyy ayyy
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life  Ayyy ayyy ayyy
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life  Ayyy ayyy ayyy
No tellin' where it'll take ya

'Cause I'm a paper chaser
Just livin' my life  my life 
My life  my life 
Just livin' my life  my life 
My life  my life  just livin' my life
I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate, but still I'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems with their record sales just holler Tip
If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game, but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?
You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are

So live your life  Ayyy ayyy ayyy
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life  Ayyy ayyy ayyy
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life  Ayyy ayyy ayyy
No tellin' where it'll take ya
Just live your life  Ayyy ayyy ayyy
'Cause I'm a paper chaser
Just livin' my life  my life 
My life  my life 
Just livin' my life  my life 
My life  my life  just livin' my life
Got everybody watchin' what I do, come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And I'm not goin' awayyyyyyy
So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
Look in the mirror, and keep on shinin' 
Until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot
Livin' the life, the life
In the Windmill City got my whole team with me
The life, my life
I do it how I wanna do
I'm livin' my life, my life
I will never lose
I'm livin' my life, my life
And I'll never stop it

The chances I'm taking
Sometimes might knock me down, but
No, I'm not breaking

But these are the moments that
I'm gonna remember most, yeah

Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life

They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on

With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess 
Am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a JAY-Z song was on
And a JAY-Z song was on
And a JAY-Z song was on
So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, ""Yeah""

Like, ""Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks?""
""She gotta be from out of town""
So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune
And a Britney song was on

So you pray to God to justify the way

And you take your time
And you do your crime

What the saints forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Now the son's disgraced, he who knew his father
When he cursed his name, turned and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart, so he stuck his middle finger
To the world, to the world, to the world
And you take your time
And you stand in line
Well, you'll get what's yours
I got mine

'Til you're tryin' to find the you that you once had
I have heard myself cry, never again
Broken down in agony and just tryin' to find a friend
Oh
Oh
I'm safe up high
Nothing can touch me 
But why do I feel this party's over? 
No pain  inside 
You're like perfection
But how do I feel this good sober? 
I'm safe up high 
Nothing can touch me
But why do I feel this party's over? 
No pain inside
You're like perfection
But how do I feel this good sober? "

In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady (
Let's go
)
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

Back with Andre the Giant
, 
Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse, the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you, hoes
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes

It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk
Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre!
They see that low rider go by, they're like, ""Oh my"" 
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why
I dip through in that Six-Trey like, ""Sick 'em, Dre!""
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Drivin' 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado?
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco
, 
beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though 
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto

And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk
And I take great pleasure in introducing 50 Cent
It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up
, and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marijuan', do what you want
Nigga, on and on 'til the break of what?
Get the paper, man, I'm cakin', you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothin'
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown, motherfucker, I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit 
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick? 
Fat-ass Birkin bags, some classy shit 
Jimmy Choo shoes; I say, ""Move,"" a bitch move
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust

Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the mornin'
And throw on what I wanted, then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home
If I were a boy
I think I could understand, oh-ooh
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted 
'Cause he's taken you for granted 
And everything you had got destroyed
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong
But you're just a boy
You don't understand 
How it feels to love a girl
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you're just a boy"

And right now radio's all that we can hear
Now we ain't talked since we left, it's so overdue
It's cold outside, but between us, it's worse in here
The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part
Where the end starts
I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through our fingers
I don't wanna try now
All that's left's good-bye
To find a way that I can tell you
I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take your tears
I hate this part right here
Every day, seven takes of the same old scene
Seems we're bound by the laws of the same routine
Gotta talk to you now before we go to sleep
But will we sleep once I tell you what's hurting me?
The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now
I know  this is  the part
Where the end starts
I can't take it any longer

To find the one in this life
The one we all dream of

I'll know it by the feeling
The moment when we're meeting
Will play out like a scene
Straight off the silver screen
So I'll be holding my breath
Right up 'til the end
Until that moment when
I find the one that I'll spend forever with
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to do it on their own 
And everyone wants to know they're not alone 
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere 
There's gotta be somebody for me out there
Tonight, out on the street, out in the moonlight
And dammit, this feels too right
It's just like déja vu, me standing here with you
So I'll be holding my breath
Could this be the end?

Sweep the streets I used to own

Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead, long live the king""
One minute, I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (
Mmm, mmm

Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air and leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head,
 
a sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems 
Leave my door open just a crack
(
Please take me away from here
)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(
Please take me away from here
)
Why do I tire of counting sheep
(
Please take me away from here
)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep?
To ten million fireflies, I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell 
But I'll know where several are if my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar 
I'd like to make myself believe

To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
Give me reason to fill this hole
Connect the space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide
There was nothing in sight
But memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide
The ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in
Between where we were standing
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve
So give me reason to prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
Across this new divide
In every loss, in every lie
In every truth that you deny
And each regret and each goodbye
Was a mistake too great to hide

And now I think that I've got it all down
And as I say it louder, I love how it sounds
'Cause I'm not taking the easy way out
Not wrappin' this in ribbons
Shouldn't have to give a reason why
It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that I stayed 'til today
Yeah, you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time, we'll find this was no surprise
It came out like a river, once I let it out
When I thought that I wouldn't know how
Held onto it forever, just pushing it down
It felt so good to let go of it now
Not wrapping this in ribbons
Shouldn't have to give a reason why
It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that I stayed 'til today
There's nothing here in this heart left to borrow
There's nothing here in this soul left to save
Don't be surprised when we hate this tomorrow
God knows we tried to find an easier way
Yeah, you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time, we'll find this was no surprise
Our favorite place we used to go
The warm embrace that no one knows
The lovin' look that's left your eyes
That's why this comes as no, as no surprise
If I could see the future and how this plays out
I bet it's better than where we are now
But after going through this
It's easier to see the reason why
It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that I stayed 'til today
Yeah, you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time, we'll find this was no surprise
The kiss goodnight, it comes with me
Both wrong and right, our memories 
The whispering before we sleep
Just one more thing that you can't keep 
Our favorite place we used to go
The warm embrace that no one knows
The loving look that's left your eyes
But I know in time, we'll find this was no surprise"

Coming out, coming out, coming out
A domesticated girl, that's all you ask of me
Darling, it is no joke, this is lycanthropy
The moon's awake now, with eyes wide open
My body's craving, so feed the hungry
I've been devoting myself to you
Monday to Monday and Friday to Friday
Not getting enough retribution
Or decent incentives to keep me at it
I'm starting to feel just a little abused
Like a coffee machine in an office 
So I'm gonna go somewhere cozy to get me a lover
And tell you about it
There's a she wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free 
There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe
Sitting across a bar, staring right at her prey
It's going well so far, she's gonna get her way
Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent
The moon's my teacher, and I'm her student
To locate the single men, I got on me a special radar
And the fire department hotline in case I get in trouble later
Not looking for cute little divos or rich city guys
I just want to enjoy 
By having a very good time
And behave very bad in the arms of a boy
There's a she wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free 
There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

I don't discriminate, no, not at all
Kit-Kat a midget, if that ass soft, I break her off
I exchange V-cards with the retards
And get behind the Christian like Dior 'cause he are
Mack Mizzle, baby
'Cause he are Mack Mizzle, baby
And I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world

70,"""If Today Was Your Last Day""",Nickelback,https://genius.com/Nickelback-if-today-was-your-last-day-lyrics,"My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday? 
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have?
If today was your last day
Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the prize is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try
So live like you'll never live it twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday? 
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have? 
And would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies? 
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love? 
If today was your last day
If today was your last day
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes 
'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
Let nothin' stand in your way 
'Cause the hands of time are never on your side
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have? 
And would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies? 
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?

Yeah, I know you ain't over there staring at my girl
Nigga, I know you don't call yourself hollering at my girl
Now I know you don't call yourself hollering at my girl

Gucci down to her feet

I'm the one, with them ones
Fuck the price on the tag, just throw it in the bag

Just ask my baby gal, I treat that lady well
Ain't nothing so-so, and I know J.D. well
A couple Benzes, black, white, gray C.L
Got niggas looking like, ""Did we miss a Mercedes sale?""
Don't wonder what I do, just know they pay me well
They keep that Gucci and that Louis on my labi-el's
That's the way we feel -- must be nice, man
You with the right man, you ain't gotta price scan
Or ask how much, now what I look like?
Son I'm from Brooklyn -- what it look like?
You get it cause I got it, I got it so you get it
In Miami they say, ""Don't stop, get it, get it""
Mami do the Speedy, daddy do the duffle
Bag full of chips, we ain't talking Ruffles

Just throw it in the bag
Paper or plastic
, it's safer to ask it
So dead that nigga, I will pay for the casket
That Remy Mar' got him spitting plenty bars
Broke ass nigga, couldn't buy the mini bar
So get with Loso, he ain't got to know so
Such a gentleman, dozen bottles of that Rose Mo'
Oh you got a man? Well, you need a richer one
Meet me in the parking lot, the plates say ""GET U 1""
Meet me at the register, I'm there on the regular
Them niggas price checking, you can help them in a second

Pass out at three, wake up at ten
Go out to eat, then do it again

I wanna go to college for the rest of my life
Sip Banker's Club, and drink Miller Lite
On Thirsty Thursday and Tuesday Night Ice
And I can get pizza a dollar a slice
So fill up my cup, let's get fucked up

I am champion, at beer pong
Allen Iverson, Hakeem Olajuwon
Don't even bounce, not in my house
Better hope you make it, otherwise, you naked

I danced my ass off and had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed

Like don't pass out with your shoes on
And don't leave the house, 'till the booze gone
And don't have sex, if she's too gone
When it comes to condoms, put two on
Then tomorrow night, find a new jawn
Hold the beer bong, nothing wrong with some fun

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I"

Nigga just woke up with it
Fresh out the bed watch me turn my swag on
Like I'm SouljaBoy tell em' who did it
Brodie bought a brand new drop who in it?
Somebody gon' die today yes you 
Bro just pulled up with a brand new semi
He talk out his neck we gon' send him to Whitney
I was pissed off yesterday bitch kept calling my phone tryna make me mad
Shit, imma do what I do I'm a rockstar 2020 gem with a whole lotta' cash
Make no mistake if we racing lil bro said 200 miles on his dash
Bro I was up all night in the stu' made 22 songs and this shits all gas
And he know I'm his dad, dad
Ha, and I know that you mad, mad
We gon' run through your house if the front door is locked it's okay  we gon' go through the back
Wild boys still smoking on thrax
Got on beam in the back, get back
You lil' niggas all duck duck, quack
I'm on it I'm on it that's my name its Daij, hold up relax
Big kicks on so they know that I'm lit
If he want the smoke, Teezo empty the clip
Internet talking can't believe they think he phase me
Extended clips on rifles we got big guns like the navy
Shorty pulled up and she served me some crank
Ion mean the drug she let me hit from the back
Your squad full of pussies like you chilling with cats
Fuck corona virus, we should kill all the bats
Drop top, Lincoln, like I'm John F. Kennedy
Baby let me cuff you pick you up in my Infiniti
Take you to the movies recreate the human centipede
Bring her home by 9 don't want her parents to be enemies"

Travel in your mind, explore your sexuality
Melt your imagination, & mold it into reality

Can you feel the pictures that I painted
Cause all of them are related like a mother & a son
But none of them overrated
There no others, you the one
Our destiny is to make it
Gotta thank you just for sharing your world
It's so real, an inspiration for no reason
But thinking that I'm incapable of taking on the duty of making you interchangable
The thought is sensational, it's perfect bliss
I'm ready to take the milky way to your hershey's kiss
You know my tongue's got batteries in it
The bedroom, we lose calories in it & start families in it
And dnt worry cause the situations under control
So let me dive in your heart & swim around in your soul 
Take me, I'm yours, shorty
As we rock to the left, rock to the right
Lend me your body & we'll rock it all nite
Tell the niggas hollaback, tell your girls goodnite

I swear you gonna make a nigga fall in love "

Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine
And that's home, you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie, and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house, it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground
And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
It's funny how it's the little things in life
That mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive
Or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind
This I've come to know
So if you agree, have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast
To a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly, let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives
So we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love
Like our chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
Get your little chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've done seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love"

And now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world

The way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea
Stronger than it’s ever been
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then
And I remember taking you back
To right where I first met you
You were so surprised
There were people around
But I didn't care
I got down on one knee right there
And once again
I thought I loved you then
Now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea
Stronger than it’s ever been
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then
I can just see you
With a baby on the way
I can just see you
When your hair is turning grey
What I can't see
Is how I'm ever going to love you more
But I've said that before
And now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world

Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull they cameras out and, goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane
Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, huh
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane
There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, woah
He can make them look like bozos,
 
he's wonderin' if he should spit this slow
Fuck no, go for broke,
 
his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes and establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited, you can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains who stand inside of the booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings come flyin' up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback, motherfucker, for the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouths with a bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place, so, Drake
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane"

I run from hate
I run from prejudice
I run from pessimists
But I run too late
I run my life
Or is it running me?
Run from my past
I run too fast
Or too slow, it seems
When lies become the truth
That's when I run to you
This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster, so I run to you
I run to you, baby
And when it all starts comin' undone
Baby, you're the only one I run to
I run to you
We run on fumes
Your life and mine
Like the sands of time
Slipping right on through
And our love's the only truth
That's why I run to you
This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster, so I run to you
I run to you, baby
And when it all starts comin' undone
Baby, you're the only one I run to
I run to you

There's a cure, you found it
Slow motion sparks, you caught that chill
Now don't deny it
But boys'll be boys, oh, yes, they will
They don't wanna define it
Just give up the game and get into me
If you're lookin' for thrills, then get cold feet
Oh, no, I do not hook up, up, I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand and your heart on your sleeve
Oh, no, I do not hook up, up, I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try, the harder I'll fight
To say goodnight
I can't cook, no, but I can clean
Up the mess she left
Lay your head down and feel the beats
As I kiss your forehead
This may not last, but this is now
So love the one you're with
You want a chase, but you're chasin' your tail
A quick fix won't ever get you well
Oh, no, I do not hook up, up, I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand and your heart on your sleeve
Oh, no, I do not hook up, up, I fall deep

Could be over

You think you can get whatever you want, 'cause you some kind of star""

Hey, if I were you then, it would be me that I'd go home with
Three, the one and only, one thing you ain't considered
I heard you when you told your girl, ""Ooh, he can get it""
Admit it, you did it, let's hop a cab, and split it
I'm kidding, we both goin' to where you livin'
Ha, I got you gigglin' like a piglet, oh, that's the ticket?
I hope you more like, Anita Baker, than Robin Givens

Were at the bar
 and we
Were having us some beers and
Swapping I don't cares
Talking politics
Blonde and red-haired chicks
Old dogs and new tricks and
Habits we ain't kicked
We talked about God's grace
And all the hell we raised
Then I heard the ol' man say
God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy
He said ""I fought two wars
Been married and divorced""
What brings you to Ohio?
He said ""Damned if I know""
We talked an hour or two
'Bout every girl we knew
What all we put them through
Like two old boys will do
We pondered life and death
He lit a cigarette
Said ""These damn things will kill me yet""
But God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy
Last call is 2 a.m
I said goodbye to him
I never talked to him again
Then one sunny day
I saw the old man's face
Front page obituary
He was a millionaire-y
He left his fortune to
Some guy he barely knew
His kids were mad as hell
Huh, but me
I'm doing well
And I drop by today
To just say thanks and pray
I left a six-pack
Right there on his grave
And I said
God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy
God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy
God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy"

And her lips that taste like sweet red wine
And her pretty legs go to heaven every time

And when she walks in the room, I can hardly breathe
Got a devastating smile, knock a grown man to his knees
She got whatever it is, it blows me away
She's everything I wanna say to a woman, but I couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is, I don't know what to do
'Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel, it comes out ""I love you""
You got whatever it is
You know I've never been the type that would ever wanna stay
Bring 'em home at night and they're gone the next day
But that all changed when she walked into my life
And people ask me what it is, tell 'em I don't know
There's just something 'bout the woman makes my heart go haywire
And she's gonna be my wife
She got whatever it is, it blows me away
She's everything I wanna say to a woman, but I couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is, I don't know what to do
'Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel, it comes out ""I love you""
You got whatever it is
'Cause when she loves me, girl, that's how I feel
'Cause when she loves me, I'm on top of the world
'Cause when she loves me, know I can live forever
And when she loves me, I am untouchable

Tell 'em we only want tables and we buyin' out the bottles
(
OHHH!
) Y'all know the order
Tell 'em ten Roses and a few cold waters 
Only Petron and a couple of lemons 
Ten thousand dollars stuffed up in the denims 
We standin' on couches, a couple of women 
We was ballin' hard, it was just the ninth inning 
He told shorty we could be friends 
And your friends could meet my friends 
And we could do this on the weekend or on the weekday
We could do this on the freeway and get it in the freak way
SHIT! 
We could get in on three way
 
Blackberry two way, souped up cars on the thruway
 
We superstars, no Lupe
, 
we could do this like a duet
But y'all be the singers on the mic
, wait let me dim the lights
This was in the car while I was stoppin' at the light
How we ball in the club, I know you hate it
Mami dancin' on the floor all like she naked
When she laid out with you, I know she fake it
All the girls give it to me I ain't gotta take it
Oh ohh! Pop champagne!
Oh ohh! Pop champagne!
Oh ohh! We pop champagne!
Oh ohh! We pop champagne!
Baby I wanna see you work  See you dance 
Without no shirt, without those pants
Pop champagne ain't a damn thing change
Spray it in the air make it champagne rain
Buckets of ice keep the champagne cool
Mommy got a body see that damn thing move
But, it's no sex in the champagne room
Says who? Baby, I break all rules
Bring it here and I'll break off you
She see me in V.I.P. and wanna break on through
When she with you, she lyin, but she fake it
When she with me, she like it, she never fake it
I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance
How we ball in the club, I know you hate it
Mami dancin' on the floor all like she naked
When she laid out with you, I know she fake it
All the girls give it to me I ain't gotta take it
Oh ohh! Pop champagne!
Oh ohh! Pop champagne!
Oh ohh! We pop champagne!
Oh ohh! We pop champagne!"

100,"""Never Say Never""",The Fray,https://genius.com/The-fray-never-say-never-lyrics,"Some things we don't talk about
Rather do without and just hold the smile
Falling in and out of love
Ashamed and proud of, together all the while
You can never say never
While we don't know when
But time and time again
Younger now than we were before
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Picture, you're the queen of everything
Far as the eye can see under your command
I will be your guardian when all is crumbling
I'll steady your hand
You can never say never
While we don't know when
But time, time, and time again
Younger now than we were before
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
We're pulling apart and coming together again and again
We're growing apart, but we pull it together
Pull it together, together again
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go"
