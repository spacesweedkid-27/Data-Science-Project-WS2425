# Data Science Project

## Issues
- basic organization will be done using issues
- issue titles should be short and concise
- if necessary, add a description to the issue to further clarify the todo
- each issue should correspond to a milestone
- if the due date of an issue differs from that of the corresponding milestone, add an earlier due date
- each issue be assigned to at least one person
- if you're looking for something to do, look through not-assigned issues and assign yourself an issue to work on

## Commits
- commit messages should be short and concise
- Each commit message should include the associated issue-number #issuenumber. This way, work on one issue can be clearly identified through commits.

## Issue-Stati
- currently, there are four stati (status? statoden?): todo, in progress, review and done
- todo: work on this issue hasn't been started yet
- in progress: work on this issue is being done, but not completed yet
- review: work on this issue is done - it needs to be reviewed
- done: work on this issue is completed and has been reviewed; there is no need for further work on this issue

## Review process
- once a person finished work on an issue, this person changes the issue's status to "review" and unassigns themselves
- another person looking for something to do can assign themselves to any issue in "review" state
- if there's flaws, leave a comment within the issue and describe what needs to be fixed
- then, put the issue back into "in progress" status and assign the person that's worked on the issue previously
- if there's no flaws, change the issue's status to "done"
